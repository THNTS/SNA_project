YOU MIGHT WORK ON

Check out our engineering blog for some examples of past work. Here are some other examples of recent and future projects:
Tools to simulate DNA assembly - computers can assist scientists by informing scientific decisions with complex calculations. Our bulk assembly tool allows scientists to simulate constructing hundreds of DNA constructs in parallel, visualizing the end result and highlighting potential issues.
Complex querying and visualization tools - The big advantage of keeping all your data stored in one system is that you can query that data all at once, without digging up multiple sources. This works best when you can query Benchling the same way you can query a database: by choosing from a large number of possible filters on any related objects, joining together various sources, and performing aggregations. We want to enable this in a user-friendly experience, without leaving your browser.
A customizable computation platform - Biologics are typically large protein complexes composed of a number of shared parts. We want to let scientists specify computations that can aggregate data across all of these related entities to surface derived values, which can be used in everything from data analysis to naming schemes. Scientists may develop custom protein analysis algorithms or proprietary validation logic - they'll be able to hook in custom code and push that computation to Benchling.
Data warehouse as a product - customers can click a button and spin up a fully-managed, query-able warehouse with all their Benchling data in one place. Customers get the full power of Redshift/Postgres without having to manage ETL pipelines or tune Postgres configuration values.
A new permissions system - Our existing permission system relies on Read/Write/Admin access that can only be applied at the top level of the file hierarchy. To roll out to enterprises with 500+ users, we need to offer them fine-grained control around exactly what actions a user can take and let them manage these in a hierarchical fashion.
OUR VALUES
Empower through information. We explain the ""why"" behind every decision, unless there are highly sensitive circumstances. We're honest about how we're doing, especially in difficult times. We believe that sharing information builds trust and enables better decision-making.
Rely on tenacity. Hard work is one of the greatest factors to determine success and is fully under our control. We must make the most of every day by bringing the highest level of determination. Dreaming big is not enough.
Raise the bar. Pushing ourselves and others to improve will be uncomfortable and at times result in failure. However, it's critical to our success. We're dedicated to creating a place where everyone feels challenged to improve.
Build a lever. We choose to build tools and infrastructure that will help others make world-changing innovations. There's less glory in it, but in the words of Archimedes, ""Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.""

Though we use many tools, depth of experience with Python and its use with distributed and real-time systems (Celery + Redis / RabbitMQ, Kafka + Faust, etc) will be central to this role. Deep working experience with the placement of different kinds of data in microservice architectures will be a critical element of this role as we work towards the infinitely scalable future. Shared tools such as Kubernetes, Docker and Git should be second-nature.

As a deeply technical lead, the ideal candidate will prefer spending about 50% of their time actually writing code, splitting the rest between planning and mentorship and code review. We are looking for an engineer who has already seen success in growing their team around them, as well as engineering highly available high-throughput distributed systems.

Reducing latency and improving reliability of our internal APIs
Collaborating on system design to optimize petabyte-scale data set management
Supporting frontend developers in expanding our labeling and management system
Within the first 6 months
Designing distributed computing infrastructure for real time data processing
Scaling computer vision algorithms to run massively parallel in production
Determining technical roadmap based on current tech maturity and business objectives

What you should have:


5+ years Python experience with mastery of modern language features and libraries
Depth of experience with large scale distributed and real-time systems, microservices, infrastructure, frameworks, and datastores
Second-nature familiarity with shared tools: Kubernetes, Docker, Git, Kafka, Redis
You recognize the need to balance pragmatism and creativity
You have made mistakes, learned from them and avoided making them again.
You are able to use your knowledge and experience to help solve problems that may not be in your field of expertise
You work well with a diverse team of high-quality people focused on customer delight.
You can rapidly become familiar with and apply new tools and technologies

Educations & Certifications:


BS or equivalent experience in Computer Science or Computer Engineering

Grabango Values:
Integrity: Do the right thing, particularly when you don't have to.

Bold Innovation: Think recklessly, but temper your actions with pragmatism.

People Matter: Hire the best, and treasure them.

Don't Live with Broken: Have the courage to admit mistakes, and the urgency to correct them.

Customer Focus: Deliver beyond expectations, both internally and externally.

Inclusion: Foster an environment that welcomes all.

Simplify: Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.

Grabango is proud to be an equal opportunity employer and is committed to developing a workplace where diversity and inclusion are an essential part of who we are. We strive to hire and support a workforce as diverse as our shopper base, so we can develop products and services that best suit our customers. We do not make employment decisions based on race, color, religion, ethnic or national origin, nationality, sex, gender, gender-identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, military or veteran status and we comply with all local, state and federal employment laws.

ABOUT OUR ENGINEERING TEAM
Our engineering team demonstrates and values technical thought leadership.
Qualia hosts the official Meteor Developer's Night in our San Francisco HQ, which is the largest gathering of Meteor developers in the world. The event features talks on Meteor and Javascript development generally, often including talks from Qualia team members.
Qualia's Head of Design, Jack Lukic, is the creator of Semantic UI, one of the most popular open-source design frameworks. Qualia engineers learn this framework, and design patterns more generally, directly from the creator of the framework our front end is built on! Very few companies can say that.
As part of our focus on continual learning and development, a Qualia team member gives an educational talk on something they're interested in every Thursday to the entire engineering and product team. Topics range from Kolmogorov complexity theory to the definition of art, to models of existential risk.
We believe diverse perspectives and backgrounds are critical to building great technology, and our goal is to cultivate an environment where people feel equally valued and respected. Qualia is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace, and we welcome applicants from all backgrounds regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, marital status, age, citizenship, socioeconomic status, disability, or veteran status.",4.5,"Qualia

SpotOn is a fast-growing marketing, loyalty, and payments platform that helps small business owners understand and reach out to their customers and increase revenues by making informed decisions. Customers can discover businesses using our mobile apps, then at order time can check-in and pay for their orders using our mobile and tablet applications. The resulting data allows merchants to send targeted marketing campaigns, track their online reputation, and monitor the growth effect loyal customers can have on revenues, through our flagship web application.

As part of the business operations team, you would be working on various types of systems - from building APIs for exchanging data with external partners, to building web applications to manage business processes, to building out the infrastructure that is necessary to run those systems in a scalable and reliable way. We are looking for someone with at least 5 years of experience building technology solutions that have been used to solve real-world problems.

If this describes you…
You’ve seen several projects through to completion in similar roles, and either has worked or are comfortable working with, teams of various sizes.
Have an eye for idiomatic, readable, and performant Python 2/3 code, and experience with linters/debuggers/profilers/etc. which help reach these goals.
You've worked with frontend development to some extent. JavaScript land moves fast, so we'll understand if your background doesn't perfectly align with our stack (React+Redux+Babel+Webpack, Backbone.js transitioning to Vue), but we're definitely looking for someone who's used a modern framework of some sort, and isn't strictly a jQuery wizard.
You've worked with some kind of MVC framework.
Have an eye for idiomatic, readable, and performant Python code, and experience with linters/debuggers/profilers/etc. which help reach these goals
Comfortable with at least intermediate-level queries in MongoDB and/or PostgreSQL.
Experienced with Git and comfortable using a branch+tag workflow model that leans heavily on GitHub’s Pull Request utilities
Bonus: Have experience with Django, Flask, or AioHTTP.
Bonus: Have experience with JavaScript at or after the ES6 turning point. Trust us, it's a whole new world when you're able to use `import` and `async/await`. We're of course open to teaching these new features as needed.
Bonus: Have experience with both Python 2 and Python 3, and can explain some of the footguns involved in moving between these versions, and in writing cross-compatible code
Bonus: DevOps experience of any form. We’re Docker people locally and AWS/Kubernetes people in the cloud.
Bonus: You’re opinionated about tooling, process, code/test styles, etc., but not too snobby about it. Our process is flexible and ever-changing, and you’d be welcome to leave your mark on it!
… then here’s a bit about what we have to offer!
Salary Range: $80k+ annually. This is based on experience and what you bring to the table
Health, Dental, and Vision insurance
Company-provided MacBook Pro (or similarly-spec’d device if you’re more of a Linux type).
A supportive environment, where you will work closely with a skilled team of software and QA engineers, product managers, and graphic designers

We Are Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Background

Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe.

But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job. Executives, despite having millions to invest, live in fear of disruption, and still have no idea where their “next big idea” will come from, or if it will come at all.

At Brightidea, we’ve built a software platform that’s solving these problems. We’ve been helping organizations be more efficient with the 1.5 trillion dollars invested in R&D annually.

Our Company & Culture

We are a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded team of self-starters who show up every day with a singular mission: to create a world where the best ideas win. Our primary focus this year is to continue to add exceptionally talented and motivated individuals to the Brightidea team. We are ambitious, bold, highly-collaborative, focused, and we aim to win. We take a humble approach to changing the way corporate R&D teams run innovation challenges.

Anyone joining our company will have the opportunity to shape the culture and be an integral part of setting it up for long term success. If you identify with being humble, T-shaped, and relentlessly resourceful then this could be the perfect team for you to shine in.

Brightidea believes that everyone has the ability to make a difference and that a diverse team generates more innovation and bigger ideas. Just as our product invites organizations to crowd source innovation across their workforce, Brightidea is inclusive and does not discriminate. We accept everybody.",4.3,"Brightidea

Across three core Initiative focus areas of Science, Education and Justice and Opportunity, we're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and movement building, to help build an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.

Our Values

We believe we can help build a future for everyone.
We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.
We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.
Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.
Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.
