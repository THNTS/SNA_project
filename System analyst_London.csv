The Data & Analytics team builds on this with an objective to ""improve decision-making through relevant insights to achieve our mission"". We work closely with partners across the company to:
Deliver insights and improve decision-making
Cultivate DeepMind's analytics culture & community
Contribute to our analytics infrastructure
Success across these areas will have a material impact on the company's operations and management, offering exciting opportunities to dive deeply into a wide array of technical analysis, collaborate closely with talented partners throughout the organisation, and apply/grow your skill set.
Some examples of the types of work you might encounter on a day-to-day basis:
Mine large-scale datasets to understand patterns in compute demand and help plan future capacity
Analyse our recruitment process, conducting statistical tests to validate experimental changes to interview funnels
Present insights to senior management, translating analysis into the 'so what?' and identifying possible actions to take as a result
Partner with teams company-wide to understand key indicators of progress, develop and validate accompanying metrics, and visualise via dashboards / other reporting tools
Engineer tested, robust ETL pipelines to improve the availability of key data sources internally
Develop and deliver training on SQL, Python, data visualisation practices, and more
The role
We're looking for someone who is skilled at and motivated by helping to make and enable sound organisational decisions using quantitative data.
'Making' in the sense that you'll often be tasked to conduct rigorous analysis, using a variety of tools, to deliver meaningful insights. 'Enabling' in the manner that you're excited to help mentor and coach others in their own analytics efforts, and possess the skills to help bring greater consistency and robustness to our data sources and analytical workflows.
This role is technical in that it requires use of a diverse array of techniques and technologies to extract and prepare high-quality analysis. At the same time, there is a great deal of flexibility in your ability to focus on a subset of our team's broad mission and grow your skill set accordingly, whether that's in rigorous project management, deep statistical analysis, or robust pipeline engineering.
As a group we want to enhance the way DeepMind as a whole makes decisions and takes action, so there are many different ways team members can further this aim.
A core set of the responsibilities this role encompasses:
Work with partners to identify relevant high-level business questions and propose relevant data-focused analysis
Write queries and conduct rigorous, verifiable analysis (SQL, Python) to answer those questions
Communicate via presentations and written reports to a wide variety of stakeholders (with varying levels of seniority, technical and domain familiarity) – following through to ensure impact
Identify work appropriate for regular tracking, building appropriate reports and dashboards for consistency and ease of access
Manage several projects simultaneously, exhibiting good project management skills (timelines, expectations, progress, etc.)
Recommend changes to product/engineering roadmaps to improve data quality in source systems
Submit tested code into source control for review
Coach and mentor others in their own use of analytical tools and technique
About you
What we are looking for in the ideal candidate:
You excel at analytical problem solving with a 'nose for data', knowing which questions to ask of it, how to go about answering those questions, and how to ensure that your answer is correct.
You enjoy using a variety of technical tools to answer the question at hand. You recognise that there are lots of potential ways to approach a problem, and enjoy choosing the right tool for the job. You enjoy learning new technologies and techniques when appropriate.
You consider yourself 'business savvy'. You have proven experience working with various internal partners, and an intuition for which questions are most important to hone in on in service of our mission.
You are passionate about 'storytelling' with data. You're great at translating deeply technical analysis into insights and conclusions that everyone can grasp, independent of prior context or expertise. You know how to optimally express uncertainty in your conclusions, and key assumptions that have gone into the analytical process.
Qualities that are an asset
You are comfortable extracting and manipulating data via SQL (especially BigQuery and Google's StandardSQL implementation) and Python and the PyData stack (e.g. Pandas, Scikit-learn, Scipy, NumPy, Jupyter)
You might be familiar with some other aspects of ETL management (e.g. Apache Beam, Apache Spark, Airflow, Luigi), data modelling (e.g. DBT, Snowflake), and data visualisation (e.g. Tableau, Data Studio, d3.js, Matplotlib, Vega, Altair, etc.), or are at least excited to learn more
You like to 'work quantitatively', and have at least a basic solid understanding of statistical concepts that let you express ambiguity in your analysis and assumptions
You've previously taught yourself new tools/techniques to expand your skillset
You have experience partnering with senior decision-makers in a professional setting
You consistently strive to see 'beyond the data' and understand what your analysis represents in terms of actual reality/experience
You enjoy collaborating widely, and partnering with others to empower action and change
If you don't think you embody all of the above criteria, please still seriously consider applying! This role (and therefore the requirements) is broad, and we'd be excited to discuss how you see yourself contributing across it!
What we offer
You will join a diverse and vibrant environment where you can influence and have impact on groundbreaking research results. You will enjoy a creative and stimulating work environment and direct access to world-class researchers!

Our hybrid team combines the best of strategy consulting, data analytics and product development to deliver creative and impactful solutions to public and private sector clients. We go beyond the remit of traditional strategy consultancies by deploying advanced data analytics and software engineering capabilities to build bespoke tools that deliver long-lasting value – the tools and solutions we create become embedded in our clients’ daily operations. Our ever-growing client base consists of FTSE 100 retailers, prestigious Private Equity houses and governments.

As a Senior Analyst at QuantSpark, you will be joining a team of driven, entrepreneurial, and intellectually-curious analysts who are laser-focused on providing commercial impact. We're a small but super-effective team so in particular we look out for Analysts who have entrepreneurial flair and an ability to understand what's important for our clients.

Our work spans a broad range of clients from the private and public sectors including one of the UK's largest supermarkets, a leading mens fashion retailer, a strategic communications agency, Google, Young Enterprise, and the United Nations.

While our approach to supporting smarter decisions is industry-agnostic, most of our work involves analysing large datasets and complex systems within the context of optimising customer behaviour for retailers and portfolio companies owned by private equity funds. The breadth of the support we provide our clients covers strategic planning, sales, marketing, and their own product development. Some recent questions we've been asked to tackle include:
""We want to maximise gross profit within 18 months, should we double our online marketing spend to £10m in order to achieve this?""
""How can we understand customer missions at each of our nationwide stores and adjust store space accordingly?""
""Where will Universal Credit rollout happen over the next 12 months and how will that affect rental arrears?""
Requirements

We welcome applications from anyone with a track-record of super-powering decisions with data and an ambition to have practical impact. We're looking for people with a creative and robust approach to solving problems with experience of managing small teams of Analysts.

Some of our recent modelling and development work includes:
Analysing 1bn+ annual transactions to build a tool for a UK supermarket to help them decide how much space to allocate to their 1,500+ stores
Developing an ROI system to understand effectiveness of £5m+ of social media advertising campaigns
Building an automated marketing segmentation model to nudge millions of customers
Developing terrorist content algorithms to detect propaganda and work with internet platforms to tackle this content
Creating automated dashboards to help a private equity fund understand the performance of its B2C portfolio companies
Developing a location intelligence model to inform social impact communications campaigns
So who are we looking for? You will have a range of analytical, commercial, and interpersonal qualities including:
Analytical ability - bringing to bear brainpower to analyse complex scenarios
Attention to detail - demanding the very highest standards of quality
Technical creativity - applying intellectual dexterity to unusual problems
Grit - encouraging others through your ""can-do"" attitude
Desire to learn - striving to learn and to teach others
Communication - articulating yourself with precision and nous
Confidence - showing leadership with teams and with clients
Essential:
Experience of managing small teams of Analysts and Data Scientists
Experience in strategy consultancy, or in an in-house strategy / analytics position within industry such as a retailer
Demonstrable proficiency in SQL and one of R or Python

Who we are
Once upon a shirt, Nicholas Charles Tyrwhitt Wheeler (whilst studying Geography at Bristol University – we might add) had the notion that he could make a better shirt at better value than anyone else in the world!
He believed that all men; no matter their shape or size, where they may be in the world or indeed their budget; should be able to own a Jermyn Street quality shirt. A proper shirt. A CT shirt.
That was over 3 decades ago and whilst Charles Tyrwhitt (it rhymes with spirit by the way) is still famous for proper shirts, these days we are about so much more than collars and cuffs. Our purpose is to “make it easy for men to dress well”. We take care of a chap’s entire wardrobe, providing stylish solutions for every occasion. We make sure he gets what he wants, when and how he wants it.
Charles Tyrwhitt’s spiritual home and flagship store is located on London’s Jermyn Street. Our Global Head Office (Tyrwhitt Towers as it’s affectionately known) is in London Bridge. We have two Contact Centres in the UK serving customers worldwide. Our USA Head Office is in Manhattan (naturally) and we have retail and/or online presence across North America, Europe and Australia. Pretty impressive hey?
Tyrwhitteers (our people) are a diverse, passionate and entrepreneurial bunch. We enjoy a fun, engaging and rewarding culture, where everyone is empowered by our 3 BE-liefs which are; “BE the BOSS”, “BE the CUSTOMER” and “BE the BEST”. Together we celebrate, innovate and strive to achieve greatness in all things. Three cheers for the Tyrwhitteers!
Our future is exciting: expansion, growth, creativity… global domination! In truth; the Tale of Tyrwhitt has only just begun.",4.2,"Charles Tyrwhitt
