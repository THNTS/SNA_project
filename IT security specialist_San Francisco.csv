Our customers are experts in DNA design -- they send us their genetically engineered organisms for testing.
We grow their cells in our bioreactors to examine the efficacy of different protocols and their effect on yield and productivity.
Our customers monitor the state of things live via our website. At the end we send them some samples for storage or more custom analysis.

Our first product offering is a cloud bioreactor facility that allows biotechnology companies to design, run, and analyze high-throughput bioreactor experiments through our web application.

Our cloud bioreactor lab empowers upstream bioprocess R&D teams to develop and scale biomanufacturing processes more quickly and easily.

CONVICTION HISTORY

As a finalist for a job, you will be fingerprinted, and your fingerprints will be sent to the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The resulting report of your conviction history (if any) will be used to determine whether the nature of your conviction (or arrest, in limited circumstances) conflicts with the specific duties and responsibilities of the job for which you are a finalist. If a conflict exists, you will be asked to present any evidence of rehabilitation that may mitigate the conflict, except when federal or state regulations bar employment in specific circumstances, such as:

Candidates applying for positions with the Recreation and Park Department may be disqualified from consideration should their conviction history not meet the standards established under California Public Resources Code 5164.
Having a conviction history does not automatically preclude you from a job with the City. If you are selected as a finalist, the hiring department will contact you to schedule a fingerprinting appointment.
