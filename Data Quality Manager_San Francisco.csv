Why MBC BioLabs?*
For the last 14 years, we have been working to transform the life-science industry by enabling entrepreneurial scientists to create companies that are fast, focused, frugal! It used to be that it took millions of dollars and 6-10 months before a biotech startup could do their first experiment. We have radically changed that paradigm. Our labs allow startups to start gathering critical data in their first week – if not their first day; and they can do this for as little as couple of thousand dollars per month.

We give entrepreneurial scientists with a dream a chance to prove the value of their technology even though the venture community may have turned their back on them. When we started this 6 years ago, everyone said this would be a waste of time – “you’ll just create a intensive care unit for little companies.” Since we opened the doors of MBC BioLabs we have helped 175 companies get going, and those companies have gone on to raise over $4 billion and bring more than a dozen treatments to the clinic. This is what we mean when we say, we enable awesome!

However, we are not finished yet. We believe that we can continue to innovate. Working with you, we can find ways to make our startups even faster and more efficient, and that these improvements will mean that even more great science will turn into important treatments for patients.

Customer Success at Tessian

Having found exceptional product/market fit for our category-defining Human Layer Security software platform, we’re in the midst of transitioning from 'start-up' to ‘scale-up’, and looking for an experienced Customer Success manager to help define and build out the Customer Success function in the US.

Funded by VCs such as Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners, we’re building out our commercial presence in new markets and geographies and are looking for passionate entrepreneurs, builders and straight up hustlers to help us build something special. You will work closely with our evangelistic and diverse US customer base in order to demonstrate and amplify the value Tessian brings, develop meaningful relationships and deepen our relationships through cross-sell and up-sell.

Taking ownership of a rapidly expanding and strategically critical section of our customer base, you will be working closely with a range of customers of differing sizes (100 - 10,000 users), industries (legal, financial, technology, etc) and stakeholders (CIOs, CTOs, CISOs).

Working with our global Head of Customer Success, you will play a pivotal role in helping to design and execute the strategy for US customer success - through building on the success of the UK CS team and helping to start our US customer success function. You will help build a detailed view of our expansion opportunities and a strategy for optimizing customer growth.

As well as being responsible for renewals, expansion (up-sell and cross-sell) and advocacy in our US customer base, you will act as a bridge between engineering, product and our customers - communicating our technology, understanding customer pain-points and interpreting future customer needs to inform our product development.

This role will be based in our new San Francisco office - whilst being part of a wider team with our London office, where we are headquartered. This opportunity will serve as an inflection point in your career, accelerating your development, responsibilities and achievements at a rapid pace. As the first CSM joining our US team, the opportunities for your personal and professional development are wide open.

You’ll be comfortable moving quickly and accurately, and be brilliant at continually re-prioritizing what must get done to keep Tessian growing year over year at the pace of the fastest growing SaaS companies in history.


In this position you'll get to:
Serve as the primary point of contact post implementation.
Work with customers to identify and close expansion opportunities within our customers
Develop a trusted advisor relationship with customers and executive sponsors to ensure they are using the solution to achieve full business value
Conduct periodic customer reviews - accurately assessing customer health, helping define adoption strategies and ensure value realization
Identify renewal risk and collaborate with internal teams to remediate and ensure a successful renewal
Act as the voice of the customer and collect feedback to drive continuous improvement in the product and our processes
We'd love to meet someone who:
Has experience working in a fast paced, high-growth B2B SaaS technology environment, selling enterprise software
Has 3-5 years of quota carrying account or customer success management experience, with responsibilities over retention as well as expansion
Understands the ebbs and flows of a fast paced start-up environment because your track record shows that you’ve stuck it out through the ups and downs!
Is driven & highly ambitious
Understands the legal, financial and professional-services sectors
Has a proven track record of working in a competitive, fast-paced and high pressure environment
Is a best-in class communicator, both verbally and in writing
A unique experience that you believe is relevant and an advantage. Every CSM is different and we embrace that.

Innovate Public Schools is a nonprofit organization focused on improving public schools to make sure that all students - especially low-income students and students of color - have access to schools that will prepare them for success in college, careers and life. We publish easy-to-understand data and research to inform the public about which schools are excelling and which ones are struggling, as well as about the policy and school-based solutions that work. We work with educators from both school districts and charter schools to start excellent new public schools and redesign chronically low-performing schools. And we support and empower parents in high-need communities so they can effectively advocate for better schools and sustain community efforts over the long term.

ONLINE LEARNING LITERACY INITIATIVE
During the 2020-21 school year, Innovate Public Schools will be piloting a new initiative in response to the sudden and deep need for parents to support their children’s distance learning.

The global COVID-19 pandemic has quickly revealed America’s deep digital divide and unequal access to education. Overnight, millions of parents became their child’s primary teacher. Most of them, especially in under-resourced communities with struggling schools, had very little support in doing that. Many whose children had been behind grade-level or otherwise academically struggling pre-pandemic found themselves needing even more support with the introduction of distance learning.

Innovate’s community organizers have connected with hundreds of our parent leaders since in-person classes were suspended, and have surfaced needs and connected parents to resources and each other. The needs of these families who are impacted by the “digital divide” can be sorted into four categories:

1) Access to devices (computer, tablet, etc)
2) Connection to the Internet
3) Knowledge of how to connect/install/use technology
4) Knowledge of how to find and use high-quality online resources to support their child(ren)’s learning at home

We have seen that providing computer and internet access alone (needs 1 & 2) and even providing the tech know-how (need 3) are necessary, but insufficient to fully address all students’ educational needs. While many school districts, government entities and private sector groups are doing the critical work to address 1-3, Innovate is focusing on need 4 above. Innovate's Schools Team has started creating materials and offering training to help parents champion, guide and support their children’s learning at home and truly become co-educators.

We now seek to hire a Program Manager who can lead this initiative and take it into its next phase: implementing a model of distance learning coaching for parents (including webinars, small group workshops, and 1:1 support) and drawing connections between this work and our community organizing work. We see this as a full-time, temporary position (lasting for one year), with the possibility of being extended if the program is successful.

OPPORTUNITY
Reporting to the VP, Schools, the Program Manager, Online Learning Literacy Initiative will lead a pilot program to build the capacity of low-income parents to support their childrens’ online learning by creating a training and coaching model designed to guide and support parents in navigating online learning tools and resources. This is an excellent opportunity for a successful former teacher with a demonstrated track record of academic achievement by low-income students, and who is comfortable with technology basics (connecting to the Internet, using online resources). A successful candidate will be very interested in building relationships with parents and will believe in the power of parent leadership. We are seeking someone who is entrepreneurial and can set a vision for this work with parents. The ideal candidate is a self-motivator to execute on the vision through direct training of both parents and use of a “train the trainer” model to train additional Innovate Staff on the content curated for the program.

Responsibilities
Create and set the vision for the scope of the program (with the guidance from the VP of Schools) through the end of the term of the position
Curate existing online education resources for a parent audience, and create and deliver training content (digital, print, webinars, workshops) to assist parents in supporting their children’s distance learning

Integrate community organizing into the model to inspire and develop new parent leaders
Refine and improve the program: assess the success of your efforts, iterate, adapt, experiment, improve, and assess again
Collaborate closely with the Innovate parent organizers
Respond to emerging needs of the organization, as determined by the VP, Schools and the CEO
Qualifications
Passion for Innovate Public Schools’ mission to initiate, support, and advocate for great public schools for low-income children and children of color.
At least 2-3 years of teaching experience in a public school serving low-income students of color, with a proven track record of accelerating student academic achievement gains

Deep commitment to elevating parent voice and developing parents as leaders
Knowledgeable and experienced in best practices in online learning
Superior written, verbal and presentation communication skills with the ability to quickly and clearly convey complex topics to multiple audiences
A collaborative project manager: Can manage multiple project elements involving different individuals and teams to meet collective goals on time and with excellence.
Outstanding interpersonal skills, with a demonstrated ability to create positive, trusting, and professional relationships with a diverse range of audiences, partners and constituent groups
Strong leadership skills and a demonstrated ability to contribute to setting vision and strategic direction
Demonstrated ability to work comfortably in a fast-paced environment. with the ability to excel in a work environment requiring flexibility, self-motivation, self-directed problem-solving, collaborative work style, results-orientation, sense of urgency and enthusiasm
Deep understanding of and experience using restorative practices in educational (and other) settings
Bachelor’s degree or equivalent required. Master’s degree in education, policy, school leadership or related field preferred
Written and oral fluency in Spanish required.
Location: This position is entirely remote due to COVID-19 precautions, but will work out of one of our San Francisco Bay Area offices (San Jose, San Francisco, or Peninsula) - and will involve significant local travel within the San Francisco Bay Area - as soon as possible once guidance from state and local health officials say it is safe to do so.
