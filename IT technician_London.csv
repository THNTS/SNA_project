To our wonderful friends and followers around the world, Jagex is not pausing its search for the most talented people to join its ranks. We’re a successful, robust and growing business, after all.

In light of the current situation concerning coronavirus, we have already made changes to the way we recruit, and of course are mindful of following all necessary processes to ensure the safety of our staff and anyone we might come into contact with.

Jagex has switched to working almost entirely remotely, and in line with that our recruitment and selection process has moved to an entirely remote one with video calls being the preferred method of interview.
Our hiring managers are engaged, we are well-prepared and we sincerely look forward to talking to you soon. Our team of expert recruiters will be in touch with you to talk you through the process and changes and what to expect.
So, don’t delay, get that application in today!

Company Overview:

A leader in creating deep and engaging experiences on PC and mobile, Jagex was founded in 2001 and is today one of the UK’s biggest and most respected video game developers and publishers.

Famed for its flagship MMOs RuneScape and Old School RuneScape, Jagex has welcomed more than 260million player accounts to its world and created a $1bn lifetime franchise revenue. Today the RuneScape franchise exists beyond running games in live operations; our titles are living games that connect and inspire millions of players, with content and experiences both inside and outside of inexhaustible game worlds.

Both RuneScape and Old School RuneScape, on PC and mobile, offer ever-evolving, highly-active worlds and our community-focussed development ethos empowers players to have a real say in how each game is shaped.

Jagex is expanding and extending its portfolio with fresh franchise titles, new IP and, in 2018 launched Jagex Partners, delivering third-party publishing and operational services exclusively for the living games of the future.

Jagex employs more than 400 people at its Cambridge headquarters and is on the hunt for talented people to work across the business to help the company to achieve yet another year of record growth and player satisfaction.

As Senior IT Technician, you will take ownership of both simple and complicated IT issues and requests from across the company. Your goal is not only to resolve these issues directly, but also to enable other IT Technicians to resolve similarly complicated issues and requests effectively; by driving the definition, improvement and adoption of all IT support and troubleshooting procedures.

Experiencing new people and places – not to mention the weird and wonderful tyre problems you’ll encounter – there’s no shortage of variety and plenty of opportunity to use your finely tuned people skills as well as your mechanical wizardry. By joining our team, you’ll be sharing your skills with the best in the business at a company where career development and training are a priority. If you’re already on your way to being a great auto technician, Kwik Fit will get you there faster.

Key accountabilities
No two days are the same at Kwik Fit – doubly so when you’re out on the open road rather than being based at a centre. Who knows what kind of tyre problems you’ll be fixing from one day to the next? Truth is, though, you wouldn’t have it any other way because you love giving it your best. Never giving up until you’re able to work out what’s going wrong. Getting stuck in until you’ve identified and fixed the problem. All the while making sure our customers and team members feel well looked-after in your capable hands.

Skills & experience
Our friendly service and top-level mechanical expertise is a winning combination that makes us heroes in the community. Striking that balance as a Mobile Technician requires a special skill set including:
The kind mechanical/vehicle knowledge that puts customers at ease
Strong customer service skills and customer rapport
Excellent route planning skills
Current driving licence
Fluent English, spoken and written
Good time management skills
A methodical approach to problem solving

Benefits
Heard the one about hard work being its own reward? That’s true here. We’ve got state of the art training academies, online learning and all the support you need to reach your full potential.
What’s more, being the UK leader for tyres and auto care means you’ll be part of the team that is shaping the future. We’ve been working in partnership with the Government to tweak innovations like digital MOTs and other to-be-revealed initiatives. Plus, we’re constantly developing new resources, from state-of-the-art equipment, to help with the most modern of vehicles, like hybrids, to creating a market leading website and having partnerships with some of the best premium tyre and part brands on the planet.
That’s what we mean by ‘you can’t get better’.

There are 4 positions available from August/September. They are at the Institute of Astronomy, The Departments of Chemistry, Earth Science and Mathematics. The exact start dates will be by negotiation.

The Institute of Astronomy is engaged in teaching and research in the fields of theoretical and observational Astronomy, and is one of the largest research institutes devoted to astronomy in the UK. There is a strong focus on data-intensive research involving large scale data sets generated by high performance computers or observations with ground based telescopes and space satellites. The IT team delivers network and computing services (mostly Linux-based, some Windows-based), and provides desktop, laptop and audiovisual support for all the Institute.

The Department of Earth Sciences is the top Earth Science department in the 2016 Complete University Guide for the UK, in international league tables we are consistently listed in the top five. The role of IT is central to much of the research carried out in the department, this includes developing sophisticated computer models of how the Earth works and interrogating large datasets produced from instrumentation in our labs.

The Faculty of Mathematics is formed from two of the world's outstanding Mathematics Departments. To support research and teaching we have a large amount of computing power, consisting mainly of a sophisticated heterogeneous network of UNIX computers with some Windows and Mac OSX systems.

The Department of Chemistry, which enjoys a world class reputation as a centre of excellence for Chemical Research and Teaching, this is underpinned by the application of wide range IT technologies and solutions to meet the aims of the Department.

We wish to appoint four trainee students: one each in the Departments at Mathematics, Chemistry, Astronomy and Earth Sciences to provide IT support to the community of researchers, students and support staff.

The key responsibilities of the roles include:
Share in staffing the Help Desk with other members of the team: triaging the problems as they come in and assigning them to the appropriate support queue or person.

Perform first line support duties chiefly but not exclusively on Linux, Windows and Mac platforms

Perform a share of the procurement, installation, configuration, decommissioning and disposal of desktop hardware.

Manage user access to data and resources using the standard tools of the Departments.

Develop scripts and code under the guidance of senior technical members of the team to improve delivery of IT services.

Assist with the installation, configuration, and disposal of server hardware.

These ""Sandwich Student"" roles will provide a great opportunity for a self-starting student to gain valuable work experience in a complex environment with real users. The major element of the role will be providing front line support however there is scope for motivated students to develop tools and processes to automate and improve the delivery of IT services. Dependent upon the person appointed, the job can expand into some of the following areas: website editing, desktop systems management, interactive web based software, programming, software application design and testing, hardware support and fault diagnosis.

For each candidate called for interview there will be a virtual tour of each department on Tuesday 24th. Each tour lasting about 20 minutes. There will also be an on-line theory test lasting 30 minutes on the same day. On Wednesday 25th there will be two 15 minute interviews with each of the candidates.

The position of VisionVoice Business Support Technician requires someone who can deliver excellent technical support both to current clients and ones who are new to the company.

About Us
Ever since its foundation in 1897, the RAC has been consistently at the forefront of developing motoring services - from introducing uniformed patrols in 1901 and roadside emergency telephone boxes in 1912 right through to the present day when we boast what we believe to be the world`s most advanced computer systems to deal with calls for roadside assistance.

In 2001 the RAC designed, developed and launched a retractable rapid deployment trailer which is stored in the back of all its patrol vans. Keeping pace with modern vehicles, which are becoming increasingly complex, all RAC patrols are equipped with the latest mobile diagnostic equipment - RAC Scan+ - which enables them to quickly identify faults that would otherwise have to be dealt with by a garage. A fleet of fuel patrols was launched in 2010 to help people who mistakenly put the wrong fuel in their vehicles.


RAC is an equal opportunities employer and a company committed to diversity. This means that all job applicants and RAC colleagues will receive equal treatment and that we will not discriminate on grounds of gender, marital status, race, ethnic origin, colour, nationality, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, religion or age.

The post is available immediately and is funded until 31 August 2023 in the first instance by a grant from UK DRI at UCL.
Key Requirements
Applicants must have a Degree (2:1 or above) or equivalent in Neuroscience, Biology, Biomedical Engineering or comparable subject, or equivalent experience.

The Department of Earth Sciences is the top Earth Science department in the 2016 Complete University Guide for the UK, in international league tables we are consistently listed in the top five. The role of IT is central to much of the research carried out in the department, this includes developing sophisticated computer models of how the Earth works and interrogating large datasets produced from instrumentation in our labs.

The Faculty of Mathematics is formed from two of the world's outstanding Mathematics Departments. To support research and teaching we have a large amount of computing power, consisting mainly of a sophisticated heterogeneous network of UNIX computers with some Windows and Mac OSX systems.

The Department of Chemistry, which enjoys a world class reputation as a centre of excellence for Chemical Research and Teaching, this is underpinned by the application of wide range IT technologies and solutions to meet the aims of the Department.

Manage user access to data and resources using the standard tools of the Departments.
Develop scripts and code under the guidance of senior technical members of the team to improve delivery of IT services.
Assist with the installation, configuration, and disposal of server hardware.
These ""Sandwich Student"" roles will provide a great opportunity for a self-starting student to gain valuable work experience in a complex environment with real users. The major element of the role will be providing front line support however there is scope for motivated students to develop tools and processes to automate and improve the delivery of IT services. Dependent upon the person appointed, the job can expand into some of the following areas: website editing, desktop systems management, interactive web based software, programming, software application design and testing, hardware support and fault diagnosis.

For each candidate called for interview there will be a virtual tour of each department on Tuesday 24th. Each tour lasting about 20 minutes.

Job Details
Introduction
BARB (The Broadcasters' Audience Research Board) is responsible for the measurement of the number of people watching television in the UK, on behalf of the television companies and the advertising industry.
Viewing estimates are obtained from panels of television owning households representing the viewing behaviour of the 24+ million households within UK. The panels are regionally representative of ITV & BBC. In each panel home, electronic “Peoplemeters” are attached to each TV. Each meter automatically identifies and collects information about the programme and channel that the panel member is viewing. This information is collected via modem each night and is then used to derive the ratings data for the BARB subscribers. Ratings data are available the next day, 365 days a year.
Our Field Technicians are responsible for installing and maintaining the TV, PC and Tablet monitoring equipment and software in panel households.
Job Location: West Wales ( Swansea and surrounding areas)
Key Outcome:
The Kantar Media technician is our representative in panel homes and is therefore expected to be professional, courteous and presentable at all times. The technician is also responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the data from the metering equipment and software in panel homes to:
Install and maintain metering equipment and software in panel homes.
Educate panel members in the correct use and care of the metering equipment.
Remove television monitoring equipment from homes that wish to leave the panel.
Educate panel members in the correct use of Kantar monitoring software.
Remove monitoring software from homes that wish to leave the panel
Store monitoring equipment in safe conditions when not installed in panel homes.
Resolve or escalate any problems caused by monitoring equipment or software in panel homes.
Liaise between Kantar management, office staff & panel members as necessary.
Report all field technician activity, including appointments, visits made, mileage etc.
Timely return all faulty meter equipment, clearly labelled.
Maintain the company vehicle in a roadworthy, clean condition.

The audio and video outputs from the TV are sampled, and also the audio from peripheral devices. In digital satellite homes, the STB will be probed to extract detailed channel data.
Candidate Specification
Core Skills The ideal candidate would have a wide ranging technical skill set based around installation and faultfinding of domestic networking ,software and AV equipment. We would also consider a background in commercial installation and support of video conferencing and multi-room installations.
1. Technical ability to install & service the TV metering equipment. The meters are non-invasive, meaning that it isn’t necessary to open TV sets and other devices. A thorough understanding of A/V routing (Scart, RGB, Composite video, HDMI etc) in domestic environments is essential.
2. Knowledge of home networking, routers,, Windows PC`s and Apple Macs/ Excel / Word and Hardware / software configurations and installations.
3. The ability to work without direct supervision to a high standard. The field technician will be responsible for arranging some appointments with panel members for service calls to designated households, and these must be done in a timely manner.
4. Exemplary customer care skills. The field technician is the representative of Kantar in the panel members’ homes. Meters are installed only with the permission of the panel members, and it is therefore essential that the field technician remains professional, prompt & courteous in all dealings with panel members.
We will be looking for evidence of the following during the application and selection process for this roles:
Demonstrable experience of A/V systems/installation in domestic environments.
Detailed knowledge of TV and peripheral technology, supplemented possibly with a qualification in electronics, audio, video or television servicing.
