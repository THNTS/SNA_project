Paga is solving the “use of cash” problem in emerging markets. Over 2 billion people find it difficult to transfer or leverage money for basic human needs. This leads to the use of cash across most of the world with 90% of transactions in emerging markets performed using cash. Our focus is to digitize cash by building an ecosystem that enables people to digitally send and receive money and delivers inclusive financial services. In all our markets, we take a partnership model in working with local banks and financial institutions.

Our purpose is to make it simple for one billion people to access and use money.

Our strategic intent is to scale an emerging markets payments powerhouse by focusing on large countries where the problems we seek to solve exist. Our first market has been Nigeria where we are the leading mobile money operator. Currently in Nigeria, Paga has a market of 200m people, 53% of whom are under the age of 33. In this, the largest economy in Africa at $405bn, only 36% of adults are banked. The statistics show, however, that 60m people are unbanked while 70m are online – suggesting that the mobile money/mobile fintech environment is poised for exponential growth.

Paga offers a consumer mobile wallet that works on any type of phone – smartphones and feature phones – and any internet enabled device. The Paga wallet is similar to PayPal/Venmo/Alipay - the consumer can link her/his bank accounts or cards or save cash in the wallet. Consumers can then use Paga for a variety of use cases – P2P money transfers, bill payments, paying merchants online or in-store etc. Customers can also access financial services from partner banks and financial institutions on Paga.

Paga reaches the mass market via a network of micro-businesses and SMEs (moms and pops), agents. The agents are independent retailers who offer Paga services in their local communities.

Paga has been recognized locally and globally and has won or been nominated for a variety of mobile money, payment operator, entrepreneurial and related awards. Most notably selected two years in a row for CB Insights Fintech 250, and Paga’s Founder and Group CEO has been identified as one of the 100 most influential people in Africa.

Data Science at Deliveroo
We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity
At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.",3.5,"Deliveroo

At Deliveroo we have a world class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.

Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.

Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.

Our data scientists come from many disciplines including mathematics, statistics, economics/econometrics, physics, psychology, finance, computer science, operations research, cognitive neuroscience and engineering. Some are formally trained in data science, some are not. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

About the role

In this role, you will be designing and building the algorithmic and machine-learning systems that power Deliveroo. You will be working in a cross-functional team alongside engineers, data scientists specialized in algorithms and inference, and product managers to develop systems that make automated decisions at massive scale. Your team has a high degree of autonomy and works at some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants.

We evaluate the performance of all our decision making machines via robust experimentation, usually through our world class experimentation platform.

We are looking for a senior data scientist from an algorithms background, to build intelligent decision making machines. These machines may:
Optimise our delivery network by making rider assignment decisions; predicting how long a leg of the delivery journey will take; or mitigating real time delays
Work out how many riders we need in a particular place at a particular time
Optimise consumer and rider fees
Optimise the consumer experience by showing the most relevant restaurants and dishes
Detect fraud and abuse from consumers, riders, and restaurants
Assist restaurants in optimising their presence on Deliveroo, for example by recommending that they improve their menus or photography, or add a popular dish
Create an ML platform to improve our ML and optimisation capabilities
Requirements:
You are someone who knows the fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research and knows when they should be applied.
You are a keen problem solver, able to think deeply about a business problem and devise a well-thought-out and pragmatic algorithmic solution. And you get satisfaction from seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.
Significant experience building intelligent decision making machines in industry.
Significant experience with end to end productionisation of these models
Ability to take a fuzzy business objective and turn it into a problem that can be solved via machine learning and optimisation, in particular experience in selecting business-appropriate objective functions
Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences
Experience creating new decision making machines from scratch, and designing and building MVPs that quickly get results
Experience mentoring junior colleagues
A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact
Data Science at Deliveroo

We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.",3.5,"Deliveroo

Data Science at Deliveroo
At Deliveroo we have a world-class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.
There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.
Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.
Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.
Further, we have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.
About the Role
The central Customer Care management team is expanding rapidly and the Global Workforce Management & Planning team needs to mirror this growth in order to provide outstanding support to our Customer Care teams. We currently cover twelve markets across Europe, the Middle East and APAC.

We are looking for a data scientist from an algorithms background, to build intelligent decision making machines, primarily to work with the Global Workforce Management & Planning team to help develop and implement resource planning methodologies in order to drive efficiencies and bring a consistency of approach to all markets. You will have a high degree of autonomy and work on some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants relating to customer contacts.
You are someone who knows the fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research and knows when they should be applied. You are a keen problem solver, able to think deeply about a business problem and devise a well-thought-out and pragmatic algorithmic solution. And you get satisfaction from working with non-technical stakeholders and seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.
Requirements:
Ability to produce accurate workload forecasts accounting for trends and seasonality in contact rates and order volumes
Ability to produce simulations and what-if scenarios to assist with business cases and provide headcount and cost projections to support managerial decision making
Strong foundation in fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research
Significant experience building intelligent decision making machines from scratch in industry, designing and building MVPs that quickly get results
Proficient in exploratory data analysis, model/algorithm selection, model pipeline development
Ability to see the bigger picture and understand how your insights are aligned with the direction the business is heading in. You should also be proactive in gathering input from relevant stakeholders to enhance the accuracy and relevance of analysis you produce
Comfortable working in a fast-moving environment with changing requirements
Experience creating strong relationships with customer care operations and support teams and finance managers
Communication skills that clearly present ideas, theories, and technical information to operations and managerial staff

It's a bonus if you have:
Experience using a Workforce Management system in an administrative role within a customer care environment
Experience deploying models to production and experiment monitoring
Experience mentoring junior colleagues

Benefits and Diversity
At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

92,Database administrator,London,Quantum Machine Learning Scientist,-1,"Cambridge Quantum Computing (CQC), is dedicated to developing and deploying advanced scientific research to lead us into the quantum age. CQC’s mission is to develop the world’s best quantum-based products and to make meaningful impacts on humanity.

Quantum machine learning (QML) is one of the most interesting applications of quantum computers. For example, parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) can be trained to perform tasks such as classification, regression, and generative modelling (see our recent Topical Review [1] for an introduction).

QML algorithms can be successfully implemented using hybrid quantum-classical systems and are amongst the most promising techniques to show a near-term impact on real-world problems. Firstly, it has been empirically shown that they can cope with noise, a limited number of quantum bits, and shallow circuits. Secondly, it has been theoretically shown that some classes of circuits have remarkable expressive power and share many aspects with classical neural network models. Also, QML borrows many concepts with Deep Learning and other areas of statistical learning and these links have not been thoroughly explored; in this respect, it offers great opportunities to Machine Learning experts interested in quantum computing applications.

The field is thriving with new ideas and open questions such as proving quantum advantage, assessing computational complexity, designing variational circuits, and efficient state preparation, to name a few.

CQC is looking to expand its cutting-edge Machine Learning and Quantum Algorithms team with a full-time research lead. The role entails contributing to world-class scientific research on quantum algorithms for supervised [2] and unsupervised [3] learning. We are also looking to expand our research portfolio in directions that can demonstrate the impact of PQC on computational techniques with business applications. The research will be both theoretical and aimed at prototyping and benchmarking new algorithms on the state-of-the-art of quantum computers.

This position is embedded in a team of world-class academics focusing on hybrid quantum algorithms for near term application, such as combinatorial optimization and Monte Carlo sampling, in partnership with some of the global leaders in the financial, manufacturing, chemical and shipping industries.

About Cuvva
We’re making insurance radically better. How? By building insurance that’s fair and flexible.

Insurance is completely broken. It’s outdated, complicated, rigid – and we get it, insurance (as you know it) doesn’t sound very exciting. But we’re doing things differently. Using pretty cool technology, we’re making insurance way more fit for the 21st century, building products that actually solve problems.

We were the first company in the UK to sell hourly car insurance via an app. And we’re also the only insurance provider that provides in-app customer support with an average one minute response time. We’ve sold over 2 million policies and supported over 300,000 customers. We’re a strong, talented team of 80+ and growing.

About Cuvva
A new kind of insurance
We started with a problem: nobody was offering short-term car insurance by the hour.
But we soon realised insurance isn't just lacking. It's completely broken. It's built on layers of middlemen and outdated systems. So Cuvva turned from a simple idea into a full-blown mission: to offer insurance the way it should be.

We think insurance should be fast, flexible and clear. So we've cut out the middlemen, ditched the jargon and put our heart and soul into customer support.",4.3,"Cuvva

Nested is redefining estate agency in the UK. For too long, sellers have been subjected to unresponsive agents and broken processes. With a combination of groundbreaking technology and expert local agents, Nested is fixing the whole moving experience one problem at a time.

Today, estate agents get away with doing half a job, getting a seller under offer before leaving them to navigate the rest of the process by themselves. Nested is built for movers, the first estate agent to support both the selling and buying process, for no extra fee. We can even make sellers chain-free, with our groundbreaking cash advance securing their ideal home before they sell.

We are a pioneering team, backed by Europe’s top VCs and led by an experienced, hands-on founding team. We're all contributing remotely to build a new era for home movers, with plans to optionally work from home 3 days of the week in the future when we can spend some time in our Farringdon office again. When work is over, there’s always been plenty of socialising, from film nights to sports days or more socially distanced activities in the park.

If redefining an entire industry is something that motivates you, come and join the team at Nested.

Having a big impact: the success of our data engineers and our team is the business value we create, which means focusing on impactful areas and problems
The candidate:
First and foremost, you’re an established senior software engineer with many years of experience, well versed in agile engineering best practices, including version control, test-driven development and continuous integration
You write clean, performant and well-documented code
You have a strong understanding of Python and SQL, and are comfortable using them daily
You’ve plenty of experience (and get a kick out of) mentoring more junior developers, and perhaps managing people
You can compose simple solutions to complex problems
It’s helpful, but not required, if you have hands-on experience working with data infrastructure and tooling
It’s helpful, but not required, if you know a bit of statistics or machine learning
If the above describes you, then you should apply if:
You’re excited by what Nested is doing!
You enjoy data & solving data problems
You'd like to have ownership of the reliable and timely delivery of data for an organisation
You’re curious, and love digging into business and product problems

We ’re on a mission to reinvent care so that older generations can live longer, healthier and happier in their own homes, surrounded by their families and their communities. We use digital products, cutting-edge home connected devices and AI to empower the care community to deliver better, preventative care

Launched in 2017, Birdie is a team of 55 socially motivated care, health, product and tech entrepreneurs. We were nominated one of the top 10 UK startups to watch, the SME with the best culture in the UK and was in the 2020 Business Cloud Top 50 Start Up's list.

Birdie’s data footprint doubles every quarter so we need to use scalable technologies to ensure data remains readily accessible for our customers as well as Birdie employees.
Our product architecture is becoming increasingly decentralised - it’s crucial that product services are able to reliably share datasets amongst each other.
Birdie is integrating with more and more third party health applications to download and share data so it’s important that we can support a wide range of communication protocols.
Build data infrastructure, tools & training programs enabling product squads to:
Dramatically reduce time taken to source, process, model and publish datasets.
Improve the accuracy, reliability & re-usability of datasets.

About Cera
We are part of a rapidly growing ageing population that lacks a sustainable care infrastructure to support us to live longer, healthier, better lives to the end. At Cera Care, our mission is to empower people to live longer, healthier, better lives in their own homes. We don’t just care more, we care better. We want to be the UK leader in revolutionising affordable care for the better, for our care clients and society and the perfect coordination across care practice, data, science and technology is how we’ll get there.

About Data at Cera
Data has a critical role to play in two distinct areas. First, data about our operations, covering everything from hiring carers to the delivery of care, helps us to observe and understand how we are performing, what is working and what we could do to better deliver care. Second, data about client health, covering everything from their conditions to the health outcomes resulting from those conditions, helps us to observe and understand their experience but more importantly, it helps us to predict and prevent health deteriorations for those in our care.
About You at Cera
As an engineer in the Data Platform Team, you’ll help us realise the value of data in both of the areas above. You’ll contribute to Cera’s mission by ensuring that if there exists data that helps improve the delivery of care or the health of our clients, that we can create or acquire it and make it easy to consume by people or product features as needed to realise it’s value.

This is the first senior data engineering hire in the team. As the team and capability grows, there’s an opportunity for you to mentor others, take an active interest in their development and be promoted into a leadership or principal engineer role (depending on your interests and capabilities).

What You'll Do
You’ll work with software engineers and system owners to understand and document where and how the data is created, influencing upstream to ensure quality and integrity at source where possible
You’ll engineer pipelines to collect and protect data from multiple sources sources (e.g. APIs, Google Drive, event delivery pipelines), into a single persistent storage solution that enables everything from simple reporting to ML-backed products
You’ll work with the CTO and Director of Data to make the data architecture and technology decisions needed to deliver in the present and set us up for the future by articulating our challenges, establishing selection criteria and evaluating options before opening for comment with other engineers and tech leads (e.g. via an RFC)
You’ll implement engineering operational excellence /site reliability best practices for your data pipelines, including defining and instrumenting SLIs and setting SLOs that become a part of our team OKRs
You’ll drive your own development, and will be supported in doing so, ensuring steady progress on your path to mastery as a data engineer

Who you are
You’re committed. You’re committed to developing our ability to collect and protect data, making it easy to consume by people and our products, always ensuring it’s a source of value for the people in care operations and for the people in our care. You’re bold but thoughtful, able to thrive in a fast paced, complex data environment.
You’re a creator. You’ll apply your skills as a developer and aptitude for technology to innovate and find the right solutions for our data platform needs, challenging the status quo - there must be a better way. If it can be imagined, you make it possible.
You’re a connector. You work across product, engineering and operations to scope datasets and services that are critical to achieving our mission. You keep our carers and clients in mind, connecting their operational needs and health needs with your delivery pipeline.
You’re purpose driven. You care about the value your skills have to contribute to tackling one of societies greatest challenges: affordable care.

What you’ll need
5+ years experience developing data pipelines in a cloud based data storage and processing environment (e.g. Hadoop, Amazon AWS, Google GCP) including scheduling and orchestration (e.g. Airflow, Luigi or Celery for)
Ideally 2+ years developing event-based back end services for consumer facing features (e.g. Google PubSub, AWS SNS/SQS)
A high executional capacity in basic data engineering languages such python, NoSQL, bonus if experience in a big data language such as Scala
Experience working collaboratively with software engineers, product managers and designers in a product environment to establish what data to collect and how to collect it, to enable the insights and production features downstream
Bonus if you have a strong command of Domain-Driven Design principles, with experience applying it to software or data design at an enterprise scale
Passion for change

What’s it like to be part of the Cera team?
Our team is made up of academics, innovators, start-up accelerators and care experts, all connected by a vision to build a better future for care through the combination of best-in-class carers, empowered by technology.

About CORE

The CORE Coalition is the UK’s long-standing civil society coalition on corporate accountability - working in tandem with our partners, we’ve been at the heart of some of the biggest changes seen in UK and EU laws on corporate accountability in recent years.

CORE is a registered charity and has a membership spanning NGOs, trade unions and law firms. We work to ensure greater corporate accountability in the UK, and access to justice for people and communities around the world who suffer from UK corporate abuses of human rights and the environment: we advocate for change, we campaign for new corporate accountability rules, we raise awareness of the impacts corporations have on human rights - and build public support for the rights of affected individuals and communities.

Recent examples of our work include intervening in UK Supreme Court cases against mining giant Vedanta and oil major Shell, briefing the UK Government on the reform of the corporate transparency provision in the UK’s Modern Slavery Act, and developing and running a campaign for new corporate accountability legislation in the UK.

CORE has three staff: an Executive Director, a Senior Policy and Communications Adviser, and a part-time Finance Officer. We are supported by an outstanding board, made up of experts drawn from across NGOs, academia and law firms.

Birdie is a pioneer in social innovation. Our vision is to build a society in which we all age with confidence. With a rapidly growing ageing population, overcrowded care homes and social care services under water, we’re facing a social crisis. We ’re on a mission to reinvent care so that older generations can live longer, healthier and happier in their own homes, surrounded by their families and their communities. We use digital products, cutting-edge home connected devices and AI to empower the care community to deliver better, preventative care

Launched in 2017, Birdie is a team of 55 socially motivated care, health, product and tech entrepreneurs. We were nominated one of the top 10 UK startups to watch, the SME with the best culture in the UK and was in the 2020 Business Cloud Top 50 Start Up's list.

We are building the organisation of the future that will not only improve the lives of millions of older adults but also of our team members, our communities and will protect the environment. We demonstrate our values in everything we do. We care; we succeed together; we grow individually and strive for excellence; we are smart, brave and ambitious; and we nurture fun and a little quirkiness.

Your mission

We strongly believe that data holds the key to unlock innovation in social care. It is the foundation of how we learn as a company as well as how we enable our customers to improve their services. Our applications and services generate a wealth of rich data - it is essential that we’re able to process, analyse & deliver as much of it as possible to improve the lives of older adults.

You will define & build our next-generation data platform to enable data products which
directly help our customers to improve care via the Birdie app;
help fellow Birdie colleagues understand and improve our service.
You’ll be working across various squads to make sure that the right data is available at the right time to solve real customer problems.

How you will contribute

Your objectives when joining will be to:
Design a new data architecture in-partnership with the infrastructure & product squads using the right technologies to solve today’s problems as well as the problems Birdie will face over the next 18 months:

About Cera
We are part of a rapidly growing ageing population that lacks a sustainable care infrastructure to support us to live longer, healthier, better lives to the end. At Cera Care, our mission is to empower people to live longer, healthier, better lives in their own homes. We don’t just care more, we care better. We want to be the UK leader in revolutionising affordable care for the better, for our care clients and society and the perfect coordination across care practice, data, science and technology is how we’ll get there.

About Data at Cera
Data has a critical role to play in two distinct areas. First, data about our operations, covering everything from hiring carers to the delivery of care, helps us to observe and understand how we are performing, what is working and what we could do to better deliver care. Second, data about client health, covering everything from their conditions to the health outcomes resulting from those conditions, helps us to observe and understand their experience but more importantly, it helps us to predict and prevent health deteriorations for those in our care.
About You at Cera
As an engineer in the Data Platform Team, you’ll help us realise the value of data in both of the areas above. You’ll contribute to Cera’s mission by ensuring that if there exists data that helps improve the delivery of care or the health of our clients, that we can create or acquire it and make it easy to consume by people or product features as needed to realise it’s value.

This is the first senior data engineering hire in the team. As the team and capability grows, there’s an opportunity for you to mentor others, take an active interest in their development and be promoted into a leadership or principal engineer role (depending on your interests and capabilities).

What You'll Do
You’ll work with software engineers and system owners to understand and document where and how the data is created, influencing upstream to ensure quality and integrity at source where possible
You’ll engineer pipelines to collect and protect data from multiple sources sources (e.g. APIs, Google Drive, event delivery pipelines), into a single persistent storage solution that enables everything from simple reporting to ML-backed products
You’ll work with the CTO and Director of Data to make the data architecture and technology decisions needed to deliver in the present and set us up for the future by articulating our challenges, establishing selection criteria and evaluating options before opening for comment with other engineers and tech leads (e.g. via an RFC)
You’ll implement engineering operational excellence /site reliability best practices for your data pipelines, including defining and instrumenting SLIs and setting SLOs that become a part of our team OKRs
You’ll drive your own development, and will be supported in doing so, ensuring steady progress on your path to mastery as a data engineer

Who you are
You’re committed. You’re committed to developing our ability to collect and protect data, making it easy to consume by people and our products, always ensuring it’s a source of value for the people in care operations and for the people in our care. You’re bold but thoughtful, able to thrive in a fast paced, complex data environment.
You’re a creator. You’ll apply your skills as a developer and aptitude for technology to innovate and find the right solutions for our data platform needs, challenging the status quo - there must be a better way. If it can be imagined, you make it possible.
You’re a connector. You work across product, engineering and operations to scope datasets and services that are critical to achieving our mission. You keep our carers and clients in mind, connecting their operational needs and health needs with your delivery pipeline.
You’re purpose driven. You care about the value your skills have to contribute to tackling one of societies greatest challenges: affordable care.

What you’ll need
5+ years experience developing data pipelines in a cloud based data storage and processing environment (e.g. Hadoop, Amazon AWS, Google GCP) including scheduling and orchestration (e.g. Airflow, Luigi or Celery for)
Ideally 2+ years developing event-based back end services for consumer facing features (e.g. Google PubSub, AWS SNS/SQS)
A high executional capacity in basic data engineering languages such python, NoSQL, bonus if experience in a big data language such as Scala
Experience working collaboratively with software engineers, product managers and designers in a product environment to establish what data to collect and how to collect it, to enable the insights and production features downstream
Bonus if you have a strong command of Domain-Driven Design principles, with experience applying it to software or data design at an enterprise scale
Passion for change

What’s it like to be part of the Cera team?
Our team is made up of academics, innovators, start-up accelerators and care experts, all connected by a vision to build a better future for care through the combination of best-in-class carers, empowered by technology.
You have the opportunity to join a purpose-driven company at the tipping point of transformation. You’ll play a key part in the evolution of Cera and make a real impact, now and in the future.",4.4,"Cera Care
