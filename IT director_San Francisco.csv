Our clients (mostly in Berkeley and Oakland) typically operate networks of 40 to 100 computers, predominantly in a Windows and Microsoft Office environment. We work primarily with non-profits and value a diverse workplace. Our goal is to provide a highly-capable IT department to organizations where IT is a fundamental requirement and a strategic priority but not a core area of expertise. Join us in doing IT and doing good: you'll see the impact of your work. We are seeking a person with a broad background in Information Technology to join our firm in providing contracted IT support, development, and integration services. The ideal candidate will be both a generalist and a specialist, able to contribute depth in his or her focus areas and also able to support the full gamut of IT services with assistance from our technicians and other specialists. Our firm provides contracted IT services for clients, primarily in the East Bay, who have chosen to outsource all or part of their IT departments. Generally our clients are firms whose primary mission is not technology but who recognize that advanced, integrated, and dependable communication and information systems are key to realizing their primary mission. Through service-level agreements, we allow them to focus on results instead of on managing their own IT staff and infrastructure. This is an ideal position if you are someone who has been the sole technical support person of a small firm or large group and you want to join a team of people who understand and appreciate what you do. Or, if you've been a successful IT consultant and want to continue your client relationships while at the same time having the support of a team to enable you to truly develop and focus your specialist skills. We are primarily focused on small- and medium-sized business and primarily Microsoft-focused. Our services include everything from network design and cabling to website-, database-, and application-development. The trust of our clients is our most protected asset, so we're seeking candidates with great communication skills and an over-developed sense of personal responsibility, who can inspire and continually earn that trust. This is not an entry-level position. You should have prior significant responsibility managing and delivering IT services and be comfortable supervising the work of others. You'll need to be able to both take and give direction and to constantly keep your team up-to-date. Time management, the ability to triage and prioritize, and the ability to recognize and pursue opportunities are all key. These are big shoes, but if you're the right person and have mastered more than one IT niche, you'll recognize these shoes because you're already wearing them!

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an expansive future for all.

We adopt digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Pliancy provides white-glove, high-touch IT consulting services to Life Sciences and Finance organizations (Venture Capital, Private Equity, and Hedge). As a people-first company who invests in the long-term success of our employees, we’re looking for creative thinkers who like to solve interesting problems. Anyone can sell solutions, right? We’d rather find the right solution for our clients by discovering their unique needs and applying them to the bigger picture. We challenge the status quo to innovate towards simplicity and sustainability — that’s what sets us apart. That, and our Cloud Native-first approach, which is still rare among our legacy-solution-bound competitors. Whether streamlining a client’s race to a cancer cure or securing the fine details of data integrity, we’re driven to help people. Plenty of opportunity for out-of-the-box thinkers looking to grow their career.

What's an average day like?

The clients you'll work with are exclusively Life Sciences firms as well as Capital Management firms likely Venture Capital, Private Equity, or Hedge Funds. These clients are very friendly and enjoyable to work with. You're treated as one of their own, not as an outside individual. We're a fun, relaxed team who has a passion for technology and helping our clients through creative solutions. If you love a challenge, building relationships, and socializing with fellow team members you'll love our culture.

A typical week is a mix of four-hour and eight-hour scheduled visits consulting with your primary clients, researching solutions, implementing projects, using technology to improve process and workflows, improving documentation, training users, and responding to ad-hoc requests. You'll also enjoy catered lunches onsite or meet up with teammates nearby for meals and coffee. When not scheduled at your clients' sites, you may drop in at the local office to collaborate with a coworker on pending issues. The remainder of the time is spent with the team on internal solutions, special projects, ticket escalations, and learning new technologies.

Who are we looking for?

You're an attentive, sociable person who loves connecting with the people you support and working in a team environment. To you, clients are people, not cases to solve — you build relationships, and as a by-product, you build trust. Few things make you feel better at the end of a workday than helping your team work swiftly and efficiently toward a common goal. You look out for your people and they’re grateful for your responsiveness. You enjoy solving business problems through the clever use of emerging technologies, often pioneering the adoption of these tools.

Responsibilities:
Driving the adoption of forward thinking technology in a rapid growth environment
