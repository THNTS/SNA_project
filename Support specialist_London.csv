82,Support specialist,London,Field Team Support Specialist - Octopus Energy Services,-1,"The role
Smart meters are here. These are energy-industry game-changers, and we’re buzzing about their potential. The technology will save UK consumers a lot of time (no more meter readings!) and with innovative electricity tariffs like Agile Octopus and Octopus Go making the most of the smart meter tech, potentially a fair bit of dough too.
Octopus Energy Services (a brand new sister company of Octopus Energy) is looking for support specialists to assist in the successful roll-out of these meters. Octopus Energy has quickly established a reputation for service excellence, mainly through fast and friendly online operations - achieving a 5-star Trustpilot rating and a Which? Recommended energy supplier award for the last 2 years in a row. In fact, with Affect Energy and M&S Energy (both Octopus Energy sub-brands) 3 of the top 5 positions on Trustpilot for energy supply are taken up with Octopus brands. So we need people who can not only live up to this standard but also turn it up a notch.
The role is likely to change over time and we’ll evolve and change as the software and systems we use evolve and change. Your ability to deal with change is key. You’ll be talking to customers about the benefits of smart meters; advising on what to expect and ultimately booking their appointment. At the same time, you’ll be helping the engineers with scheduling and rescheduling their days and helping with any issues they’re facing out in the field – such as a meter that won’t commission. You’ll be working as one team with one set of objectives as we try to provide customers with great new technology with as little inconvenience as possible.
When there’s a meter installation to do in a customer’s home you’ll be at the heart of it – you’re sitting in mission control and you’re central to its success. Whilst the engineers are concentrating on the job in hand, you’ll have the tools to see the bigger picture – are we on schedule? If not, you’ll need to adapt and react. Can we call in other engineers to help? Can we move jobs around? You’ll be making sure that any changes are communicated and understood by all involved. You’ll also be responsible for ensuring that systems are updated with the necessary technical information and within regulatory timeframes.
Why work with us?
As part of the Octopus Energy Services team, we’ll ensure you have the best of everything you need to deliver the top class service we’re aiming for. You’ll have the backing of Octopus Energy’s massive tech power - so we’ll be able to constantly evolve and shift processes to ensure we’re always delivering our best service.
Is it you we're looking for?
We’re looking for team players who are up for a challenge; who want to work in a start-up environment and who get what great customer experience is.
We need people who thrive on working as part of a team – you’ll be part of a team of field support specialists, but more importantly part of the wider team of engineers. All trying to ensure we can install meters as efficiently and effectively as possible with limited inconvenience to our customers
You’ll also need to be a great communicator – you’ll need to get on with engineers who may be having a stressful day in the pouring rain whilst also ensuring our customers receive the 5star service that they’re used to. You’ll also need to ensure that everyone is updated if things change. You’ll be as at home communicating via text message or Slack as you are with using the phone.
You’ll be flexible and able to think on your feet – no two days are likely to be the same and we’ll have constant challenges in the field – your problem-solving skills will be called upon.
Empathy – engineers face challenges such as traffic and bad weather; customers with busy lives don’t want to be sat in waiting all day for an appointment – your understanding of their situations will help you make the right decisions. We’ll also have more vulnerable customers who may need additional help or advice.
You’ll be organising customer appointments and helping to organise engineers’ days – so you’ll need to be good with local geography or great with Google maps.
Adaptable – this is a new role and it will grow and move into areas that we haven’t yet imagined. It’s important that you’re up for new challenges and able to take on new tasks as the job develops.
Industry understanding – this would be a huge help – not so much going with the flow; more knowing the flow. The energy industry energy is complicated and so prior energy experience would give you a great head start.
This is what we can offer...
A holiday scheme is included, starting initially at 23 days (+ Bank Holidays) rising annually by 1 day to a max of 25 days. In addition to this, a generous pension scheme will be provided with a 4% employer contribution.

170,Support specialist,London,Customer Success Representative/Payroll Specialist (UK),-1,"The short version
Where: UK
What: Customer onboarding, support, customer relationships, etc.
Why: We believe great onboarding and support are just as important as great technology. Helping our customers get a good start at Pento and worry less about payroll is a crucial part of what we offer, and great onboarding and support is a big part of this.
The role ✨
We're looking for someone who's organised and good with people, who cares about the customer's experience as much as they care about getting their work done.
As you'd be our payroll expert, you have previous experience within an accounting/payroll advisor role.
You will be at the front row, talking to our new and existing customers. Alongside Connie Mills Michelle Nygaard and Catharrin Ponnudurai you will ensure they get the best out of Pento.
This is a great opportunity if you deeply believe providing a great customer experience is the most important goal for a company.
What will you be doing?
Your number one priority will be to make sure our customers are satisfied by providing amazing, personal customer support;
You will onboard new customers to the Pento platform as well as be the first point of contact for existing customers;
You will work closely together with our sales team, to make sure the transition from contract signed to first payroll paid is effortless;
You will learn from customer's feedback and continuously improve the onboarding process;
You will answer all questions they might have either via Intercom, phone or email (did we leave out anything?);
If there is a question you can't immediately answer, which might need to be further investigated, you will consistently ensure customers are kept informed of progress at each stage. You might not have all the answers (yet), but you are a champion for consistent communication;
You will provide the product team with customer feedback so we can continue to build the best payroll product the world has ever seen



Who are we looking for?
You have experience as an accountant or payroll executive;
You are a proficient Danish and English speaker;
You might have experience with onboarding or support/success from another SaaS company;
Your (written and verbal) grammar is impeccable – our standards are sky high!
You are a multitasker, good at managing your time and prioritising - nothing puts you in a good mood as much as completing your to-do-list;
You like to explore and use new tech to optimise your workflow, and are happy to try out new things;
You are hungry to learn. You know you don't know it all, and do what you can to help yourself and your teammates be better every day;
You work well with lots of questions and few answers. We're a startup trying to do something no one else has done before, which means we're dealing with a lot of questions and what-ifs.
About us
At Pento we're building a better, faster, and more modern way for companies to run and automate payroll. We're looking for a Customer Success Representative to help us build great relationships with our customers, and provide them with world-class onboarding and support.
We've raised a $2.8m seed investment from some of Europe's best investors, and we're now looking for new teammates to join our growing team — that's where you come in!
What is Pento?
We're a technology company, not an accountancy, payroll bureau, or similar. We build beautiful payroll software that automates all manual workflows and we usually help companies cut 50-80% off the time they spend on payroll. That means no spreadsheets, no manual bank transfers, no e-mails, and no manual work. We've built an easy-to-use software product, that does all of this automatically. Our customers usually run payroll internally, but rely on us to give them world-class payroll support in case they have any questions - that's where you come in!

The role ✨
We're looking for someone who's organised and good with people, who cares about the customer's experience as much as they care about getting their work done.
As you'd be our payroll expert, you have previous experience within an accounting/payroll advisor role.
You will be at the front row, talking to our new and existing customers. Alongside Connie Mills Michelle Nygaard and Catharrin Ponnudurai you will ensure they get the best out of Pento.
This is a great opportunity if you deeply believe providing a great customer experience is the most important goal for a company.
What will you be doing?
Your number one priority will be to make sure our customers are satisfied by providing amazing, personal customer support;
You will onboard new customers to the Pento platform as well as be the first point of contact for existing customers;

You will learn from customer's feedback and continuously improve the onboarding process;
You will answer all questions they might have either via Intercom, phone or email (did we leave out anything?);
If there is a question you can't immediately answer, which might need to be further investigated, you will consistently ensure customers are kept informed of progress at each stage. You might not have all the answers (yet), but you are a champion for consistent communication;
You will provide the product team with customer feedback so we can continue to build the best payroll product the world has ever seen

You are hungry to learn. You know you don't know it all, and do what you can to help yourself and your teammates be better every day;
You work well with lots of questions and few answers. We're a startup trying to do something no one else has done before, which means we're dealing with a lot of questions and what-ifs.

What is Pento?
We're a technology company, not an accountancy, payroll bureau, or similar.
