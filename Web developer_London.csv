73,Web developer,London,Front End Web Developer,-1,"Company description
Hackworth is a software development company whose purpose is to make programming relevant to children of all backgrounds. We're bringing programming to domains with wide appeal, instead of just the usual computing applications. We believe that increasing diversity in computing starts with broadening its appeal to children.
Job description
Hackworth are hiring a full time front-end web developer in London, United Kingdom. This is an on-site role. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, you'll be working from home somewhere in the UK until it's safe to return to a shared office space.
In this role, you'll help us prototype and build the user interface for our first product: a novel, interactive learning environment for programming, rooted in functional programming principles, with a particular focus on structure editing and the visualization of program execution. You'll join our existing team of 3 Haskell developers and (soon) a UX designer.
We're currently in the prototyping phase, so over the next 6 months, you'll have the opportunity to invent novel user interfaces and interactions for helping kids learn to program. In the spring of 2021, we'll begin production work, with the goal of beginning beta testing with schools and learning organizations by the end of 2021.
This role does not include any on-call, devops, or customer support requirements. You'll be focused exclusively on creating a great programming environment for kids and teachers.
About us
Hackworth Ltd is a well-financed, bootstrapped, private limited company based in London, United Kingdom. Our purpose is to make programming relevant to the interests of children of all backgrounds. Our first step toward that goal is to develop programming languages and tools that are designed for learning about computation.
We're committed to building a sustainable, ethical, socially responsible business. We serve children and schools; therefore, we'll never fund our business by selling ad placements or exploiting compulsion loops via loot boxes or micro-transactions. We want to build products that have genuine value to our users.
Tech
Our software stack to date is Haskell and Nix. We use macOS and NixOS on the desktop, and NixOS and AWS services everywhere else.
We've yet to decide on a front-end web-native language and framework, so you'll play a key role in helping us define this critical part of our software stack. You'll also be interfacing with our Haskell back-end, so you'll have the chance to get some experience with that language as well, if you wish.
Your qualifications
To apply for this role, you should meet the following requirements:
At least 2 years' experience developing production-quality web-based user interfaces. You should be proficient with JavaScript, PureScript, or TypeScript.
You can be on-site at our London office at least 4 days per week, once it's safe to return to a shared office space. Our standard remote working policy requires that you be on-site most days, though this policy is currently indefinitely suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
You're eligible to work in the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, we're not able to offer visas to work in the UK at this time.
It'll also help your application if you have a public GitHub, GitLab, or equivalent public portfolio demonstrating source code you've written personally. This code could be work you've done for previous employers, for personal projects, or for open source projects. Your portfolio need not demonstrate entire projects written by you — it could consist of substantial contributions you've made to third-party projects. A portfolio demonstrating novel web-based UIs or games is a plus.
If you don't have a public code portfolio, we understand. Not everyone has the luxury of working for an employer that's friendly to open source, or perhaps you don't like spending your personal time writing code for yourself or other open source projects. If you're unable to point to any substantial examples of code you've written, we may ask you to submit a relatively simple program to demonstrate your skills, instead.
If you're familiar with any of the following topics, that's a definite plus, and you should mention it in your application, but please note that these are not required for the role:
Assistive technologies (screen readers, ARIA, etc.)
PureScript and Halogen
D3.js, WebGL, or other HTML5 canvas-based graphics APIs
Structure editing a la Hazel
Block-based programming a la Scratch or Blockly
Functional programming
Benefits
We offer the following benefits:
25 paid holidays per year, in addition to public holidays in England and Wales.
We match pension contributions up to 10% of your qualifying earnings.
A generous parental leave policy.
A flexible working policy, giving employees the option of working a 4-day week with either compressed hours, or reduced hours at proportionally reduced compensation.
Flexible hours, within reason.
Bike and TfL Travelcard loan options.
A liberal, explicit personal projects policy.
We encourage employees to contribute to open source projects, and we're committed to open-sourcing as many of our own projects as is feasible.
To Apply
Important: please take note of the fact that this is a UK-only position, and that you must be eligible to work in the UK to apply for this role. Please indicate in your introduction/cover letter that you understand this requirement by asserting that you're eligible to work in the UK. Thank you!

82,Web developer,London,Backend Developer,-1,"We believe energy should be better - for you and the environment.

We’re a leading energy technology company providing a better experience for our customers through transparency, honesty and simplicity. Better for the planet, through real long-term investment in renewable generation and a low CO2 future. Better value, by throwing away the old business models of the “Big 6” and instead building a business that’s fit for the 21st century. We make energy green and flexible for consumers, with fair and transparent pricing. Through our home developed platform, cloud-based billing, and sophisticated use of data science, modelling and AI, we’re redefining what is possible in energy.

Our breakthrough Agile tariff has been widely reported as leading the way in energy innovation, and we’re passionate about fairness – we were first to uncover the widespread strategy of energy company tease and squeeze pricing and following on from this campaign, our CEO and Founder Greg Jackson presented evidence in favour of capping energy tariff prices before the bill committee in Parliament.

We already supply 100% renewable energy to over 1.5 million homes and over 12,000 businesses (including Arsenal FC and the Cardiff Blues to help them power their stadiums with 100% renewable energy) throughout Great Britain and we’re also the supplier behind M&S Energy. We’re award winning for our disruptive technology and are delighted to be the only energy supplier to pass the rigorous Which? customer service tests and be their only recommended energy supplier for 3 years in a row.

We recently secured over £300 million of investment from Origin, Australia's largest Energy Company, to help us continue our mission. This will help power our growth into new markets, build more tech to make energy greener, and increase our investment in service and growth in our existing markets (the UK and Germany). You can read more about the impact of this investment here.

Kraken is the tech behind Octopus Energy, we built it to ensure that we had the best tech backing up our top-class customer service. Kraken Technologies now delivers transformational Energy-Tech to businesses around the world to make the global transition to green energy quicker and more affordable. Read about our latest partnership with E.On HERE. Our aim is to have 100 million customers on the Kraken Platform by the year 2030.

Our team
All technology is written and maintained by a multi-discipline engineering team of around twenty people. This includes server-side, client-side and mobile engineers working closely with UX experts, copywriters and designers.
We follow a Kanban-like approach, using Google docs and Trello to specify and manage work; Github, CircleCI and Terraform Enterprise as part of an immutable-infrastructure, continuous delivery pipeline; and Loggly, Sentry and Cloudwatch to measure performance and monitor production.

Engineering standards are high. We pair program, thoroughly review and test code before it deploys, and maintain fast, high-value test suites. We have weekly tech talks, monthly blitz-days (eg sharpening our internal tools, upgrading dependencies) and can often be found at tech meet-ups and conferences.
Our coding conventions are open-source and we maintain a tech blog.

Octopus is a great place to learn, work with some talented engineers and level-up your skills.

Our technology
On the server-side, we mainly use Python. Most of our websites are powered by Django and the Django-REST-framework. We also use Pandas, Numpy and Jupyter for analysis and forecasting, plus Celery, RabbitMQ, SQS and Airflow for background processing.

We use AWS heavily, employing most of the ""Hashistack"" (eg Packer, Consul, Terraform) as part of a continuous deployment pipeline. See, for example, Django, ELB health checks and continuous delivery.

Client-side, we use React, Redux and SASS; our mobile apps are built using React Native.
What you'll do
We have lots of difficult design challenges to solve. The UK energy market is complicated, outdated and process-heavy - there's an awful lot of domain modelling that we need to get right. Strong attention to detail is essential.
We have difficult technical problems to solve. With the advent of smart meters, we'll soon be processing millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption.
There's a great opportunity for disruption in the UK energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not exactly popular. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more dis-aggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology. Octopus Energy were the first UK supplier to introduce a ""tracker"" tariff whose prices track the daily wholesale prices: http://www.cleanenergynews.co.uk/news/efficiency/octopus-offers-transparency-with-wholesale-price-tariff
You'll be working for a company that’s fighting climate change. Our parent company is the largest investor in solar generation in the UK, and are funding wind and anaerobic digestion. As a supplier, we're helping people to use greener technology and renewable energy, all helping move the UK towards a lower carbon future.
What you'll have
We're looking for someone with a general interest in technology and problem-solving; someone diligent and thoughtful. It would be helpful to have experience/expertise in the following (in rough priority order):
Python
Django (or equiv. web framework)
Domain modelling
HTTP and REST APIs
Writing robust and fault-tolerant software
Celery and async processing
Postgres
Plus experience in the following would be a bonus:
AWS
Terraform, Packer, Consul
React and Redux

Equity Options Scheme - you own your own part of the business, share options in the whole Octopus Energy Group so we all work together towards success
Office culture - have a certain tech requirement? We’ll do our best to get it. Our offices are also stocked with fruit, breakfast, great coffee and soft drinks. Weekly on a Friday we all get together (this happens virtually too) for company updates and drinks - we call it Family Dinner
Social Events - we sponsor YeoValley’s summer festival, valleyfest, every year for our big offsite Summer party (we take our kids too) and we also aim to have 3 parties a year
Parents - get access to tax free childcare and maternity and paternity pay. We’re always looking for new ways to support parents, during lockdown we created OctoKids TV to help keep your kids occupied and entertained

Shapecast was founded in 2010 and started as a boutique consultancy defining strategy and enterprise architecture in large organisations.
We wanted to differentiate our niche service offering from the more unwieldy and expensive service model traditionally employed by larger change organisations. Each client project gave us further opportunity to develop our own unique, outcome-focussed IP, which in turn gave greater value to the outcome of the transformations.
Our IP and methodology have become more and more data driven over time, and we now focus on delivering a meticulous, scientific transformation methodology based on using large volumes of data about the organisation and leadership objectives to drive the change.
Our realisation that the data driven method is the only way to gain successful results has led us to develop our own transformation analytics platform which is delivered in conjunction with our transformation services. This platform allows us to capture thousands of data points across an organisation, and generates extremely detailed and rich analytics regarding the complexity of what must change and how.
Our effectiveness of being an external organisation has been proven through our partnerships with various mid and large sized organisations which include the likes of John Lewis, British Medical Society, Jaguar Land Rover to name a few.

THE ROLE

We are looking for a front end developer who possesses a keen eye for detail and a passion for collaboration and getting features into production. Someone who wants to learn whilst delivering quality.

You would be working as a frontend developer within one of our product focussed teams, working closely with other frontend developers, backend developers, QA engineers and the team’s product manager to deliver changes and new functionality.

A bit more about us


We’re a diverse group of people. With backgrounds ranging from data science to music production, more than 80% of our team come from outside the world of finance – providing us with a unique perspective as we help consumers feel more in control of their lives. For us, an interest in people comes first; finance follows.

More about what we're doing

The apps and infrastructure we’re building are designed to place the power of personal data back into the hands of normal people. Picture this: a world where your bank knew you were paying too much for your gas bill and could switch you to a more suitable provider, or understood your savings targets and could automatically find you a better deal. That’s what we’re working towards.

We believe that diversity will make us better.


Bud’s mission is to make the money part of people’s lives simple. To get there, we need a workforce that is diverse as the people we create our products for. Which means we need people who have different backgrounds and experiences, who are diverse in age, gender identity, race, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, ethnicity, and ways of thinking. We truly believe that these differences will make us grow as a company and a team. We strive to create a workplace and culture where our people are empowered, supported, given equal opportunities and can bring their authentic selves to work.

154,Web developer,London,Front End Developer,-1,"We believe energy should be better - for you and the environment.

We’re a leading energy technology company providing a better experience for our customers through transparency, honesty and simplicity. Better for the planet, through real long-term investment in renewable generation and a low CO2 future. Better value, by throwing away the old business models of the “Big 6” and instead building a business that’s fit for the 21st century. We make energy green and flexible for consumers, with fair and transparent pricing. Through our home developed platform, cloud-based billing, and sophisticated use of data science, modelling and AI, we’re redefining what is possible in energy.

Our breakthrough Agile tariff has been widely reported as leading the way in energy innovation, and we’re passionate about fairness – we were first to uncover the widespread strategy of energy company tease and squeeze pricing and following on from this campaign, our CEO and Founder Greg Jackson presented evidence in favour of capping energy tariff prices before the bill committee in Parliament.

We already supply 100% renewable energy to over 1.5 million homes and over 12,000 businesses (including Arsenal FC and the Cardiff Blues to help them power their stadiums with 100% renewable energy) throughout Great Britain and we’re also the supplier behind M&S Energy. We’re award winning for our disruptive technology and are delighted to be the only energy supplier to pass the rigorous Which? customer service tests and be their only recommended energy supplier for 3 years in a row.

We also proudly enjoy a 5-star TrustPilot ranking from our customers. We were named the Company that’s done the most in the past year to advance UK renewables at the REA Awards 2019, and most recently, our proudest award, that of Best Company to Work For. Our group includes Octopus Energy, Kraken Technology, Octopus Electric Vehicles and Octopus Energy Services.

We recently secured over £300 million of investment from Origin, Australia's largest Energy Company, to help us continue our mission. This will help power our growth into new markets, build more tech to make energy greener, and increase our investment in service and growth in our existing markets (the UK and Germany). You can read more about the impact of this investment here.

Energy is changing.

For years, it was an industry dominated by large suppliers using outdated systems that put profits first and customers last. Now, we’re using the latest technology and green generation to transform energy for customers, bringing the UK cheaper, greener, and fairer energy.

We enjoy the best of both worlds: backing from a £6bn business of highly experienced and talented individuals, and the dynamic environment of a start-up.

We are the only Which? recommended energy supplier for 2019, the uSwitch supplier of the year, Energy Awards supplier of the year, and UK customer experience award winner for utilities.

You’ll be working for a company that’s fighting climate change. We’re the largest investor in solar generation in the UK, and are funding wind and anaerobic digestion. We’re helping people to use greener technology and renewable energy, all helping move the UK towards a lower carbon future.

And for big change, we need big minds.

We’re looking for someone who’s passionate about code, curious, and eager to learn. You’ll be working alongside other talented people in the tech department. You’ll solve problems with technology to make us, and the industry, smarter and better for customers.
What you'll have
Can write solid, semantic HTML and have experience writing SASS
Have experience with JavaScript frameworks, particularly the React/Redux stack
Have experience in crafting mobile-first responsive sites for a range of devices
Know how to develop websites that meet AAA accessibility guidelines.

We’re a diverse group of people. With backgrounds ranging from data science to music production, more than 80% of our team come from outside the world of finance – providing us with a unique perspective as we help consumers feel more in control of their lives. For us, an interest in people comes first; finance follows.

More about what we're doing

The apps and infrastructure we’re building are designed to place the power of personal data back into the hands of normal people. Picture this: a world where your bank knew you were paying too much for your gas bill and could switch you to a more suitable provider, or understood your savings targets and could automatically find you a better deal.

We believe that diversity will make us better.


Bud’s mission is to make the money part of people’s lives simple. To get there, we need a workforce that is diverse as the people we create our products for.

We truly believe that these differences will make us grow as a company and a team.

At Compucorp we are a global team who help charities to meet their digital goals.

Although this is a full time remote position, Compucorp are able to offer flexible hours of work

We work with Charities across their digital stack helping them to rebuild their processes using flexible open source tools. We help organisations reimagine the way they work so they can focus on impact.

With a team of over 40 staff we’re on the lookout for a talented front end developer with a focus on CSS Styling and Drupal theming to join our growing team.

Your principal focus will be in converting complex and challenging designs into responsive pixel perfect themes for the Drupal platform but we also develop other stand alone sites and platforms which will also require your styling expertise. There will be exposure to a range of modern javascript technologies, mainly as part of the Drupal platform in both a headless and progressively decoupled sense.

We do things a little differently, basing all our solutions on open source products, our work covers web design, app development and branding for Charities and non-profit organisations across the country. Our clients include Charities such as Wikimedia and Farm Africa, galleries such as the Photographers Gallery and Craft Central but we've got a long client list that includes other companies, trade associations and government bodies making us a rewarding place to work.

As part of a small (but growing) team you’ll have instant responsibility and an opportunity to learn new skills and explore new technologies. What we're looking for is someone who can grasp concepts quickly, has great attention to detail, and most importantly loves a tech challenge. In short, we’re a team of self confessed geeks who love tinkering and tweaking until something is just right and are looking for someone who thinks and acts like us. Please note that this is a remote position.

We love to code, and especially to create, so we’re hoping you’re going to join us and do just that.
For us, developers are not people who are just fed specifications and sit quietly churning out code. As a senior member of our team, we need you to lead, guide, plan, explain, working alongside clients and other agency disciplines, cracking problems with a mix of technical expertise and innovative thinking. It's how we outclass the competition and create the best digital experiences.
We are proud of the impact we have with our Defence and Security clients, the strength of our relationships, and the depth and breadth of our skills that we bring to help them achieve their mission – we are privileged to be asked to work with them at the heart of their biggest and most ambitious technology programmes.

Our Defence and Security customers care deeply about user experience, accessibility and of course security; good software engineering is at the heart of what we do. As part of our team you’ll be responsible for developing cutting-edge digital solutions. You'll work with some of the best developers, UX designers and strategists in the business, using digital to shape the future of how we live, work and play.

Deloitte Digital, Consulting
Part Business. Part Creative. Part Technology. One hundred per cent digital.

We’re a new type of creative digital consultancy that fuses strategy, tech and design to identify where businesses need to be, then get them there. Fast.
Through our studios spread across the globe, we help our clients imagine, deliver and run the future, through from customer research right through to implementation. And we love doing it.
As part of our team, you’ll work side by side with strategists, designers, researchers, engineers, writers, architects and product specialists – using your unique skills and perspective to help drive transformation from operational level to the C-suite, across a complete range of digital channels.
We believe in our people, which means giving them the support they need to get the best balance of work and life. Individuality, flexibility, diversity are things we’re passionate about. We wouldn’t be Deloitte Digital without it.
As part of our Consulting practice, your career with Deloitte Digital can take multiple paths. We will work closely with you on a career plan that fits your skills, talents and aspirations, and provide an open environment to discuss your development and progression with Deloitte.

Your Role
Work with outstanding talent across front-developers, API developers, creatives and UX experts, integration teams and the client themselves.
Help deliver features end to end. We don't throw our work ""over the wall,"" everyone is expected to pull together to design new features and figure out bugs.
Deliver mobile-first, responsive sites using a combination of HTML5 and CSS.
Build webapps capable of doing anything a native mobile or desktop app can do. This is the heart and soul of the modern web developer role. The possibilities in the browser should excite you to build the best experience possible for users.
Ensure your site works for users with accessibility needs, and use progressive enhancement to improve the experience for those on slow connections and weaker devices.
Help the client and end users to understand trade-offs when making product decisions, and explain why you would do things a certain way.
Keep learning! We have a great community of front-end developers who run weekly workshops together, share the best articles they find on Slack, and meet up twice a year for a full-day internal conference.
Going beyond standard duties and responsibilities to champion small details, spot opportunities and add extra value for our clients.
Your work, your choice
At Deloitte we believe the best impact is the value we add, not the hours we sit at our desk. We carefully consider agile ways of working, both formal and informal, that allow for the best impact for our people and our clients. Please speak to your recruiter about the working pattern that works best for you.

Location
Based in our airy and bustling offices in Clerkenwell, London, with its legendary coffee machine and model train track, you’ll also have a chance to work with clients throughout Europe and beyond.

Work pattern
This is a permanent contract opportunity. The role can be worked on a full-time / part-time / term-time (or other annualised days) basis.
Our team members work a variety of agile working patterns. Tell us what arrangement works for you and we’ll try to accommodate.

Your professional experience
Overall, you’re an ideas person and problem solver as well as a hands-on doer – that’s important. And you know it takes a mix of people to do amazing work, so you love collaborating with and learning from people with different skills, backgrounds and perspectives. If you have an interesting or unusual mix of skills yourself, even better.
We’re expanding fast, so we’re looking for people who are, by which we mean natural initiative-takers who bring out the best in others, are brilliant listeners and can grow our business without compromising standards, integrity or culture.

A graduate degree (First or Second class) is a must, along with British Citizenship and the right to live and work in the UK.

You’ll also have
Experience in web development
A clear understanding of the fundamentals of JavaScript development, along with good overall engineering patterns and practises. Be able to explain these clearly.
Solid working experience of at least one major framework (React, Angular, etc).
Demonstrable experience and understanding of working in teams, particularly in agile methodologies such as Scrum & Kanban.
Your service line: Consulting
Our people and the way we work are the two things that set us apart in the consulting universe. For us, collaboration is fundamental to success, along with an unrivalled depth and breadth of expertise. We work closely with our clients and each other, at every stage of every project, solving our clients’ trickiest problems with a mix of knowledge, creativity and intellectual rigour. A hugely diverse range of clients rely on us to deliver the kind of change that adds genuine, lasting value to their business.
Personal independence
Regulation and controls are standard practice in our industry and Deloitte is no exception. These controls provide important legal protection for both you and the firm. We are subject to a number of audit regulations, one of which requires that certain colleagues abide by specific personal independence constraints. This can mean that you and your ""Immediate Family Members"" are not permitted to hold certain financial interests (shares, funds, bonds etc.) with audit clients of the firm. The recruitment team will provide further detail as you progress through the recruitment process.
