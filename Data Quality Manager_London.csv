You have experience partnering with senior decision-makers in a professional setting
You consistently strive to see 'beyond the data' and understand what your analysis represents in terms of actual reality/experience

As a Product Manager at Collective Benefits, you’ll join our rapidly growing product and engineering team. While responsibilities and ownership will follow standard product processes, this role will focus primarily on partner delivery.

Our B2B business is growing rapidly and it’s essential that this growth is managed and delivered intelligently through stellar product work. What this means in practice is building the features necessary to provide customised solutions, and ensure the most meaningful and impactful solutions for our partners are scoped, prioritised, and delivered.

You’ll work closely with our Head of Product; as well as our accounts, engineering and design teams, to build functionality our users, customers, and internal team love.

Three reasons this role is great
You will join a smart and motivated team, and have the resources you need to deliver an industry leading digital product
If you are looking to make a mark in your career and learn and grow quickly - this is the opportunity for you. We have big ambitions for growth, move at a fast pace, and work autonomously with the support of startup founders and senior tech leaders who have done this before
You’ll make a difference - we’re building a business that will provide the protections that gig workers badly need
What will you do?

Partner with design, engineering, and user research to oversee the development of a product from problem definition to conception and launch (and then some).

As stated previously, this role will focus primarily on partner delivery. This means systematically tackling our backlog and delivering the specific requirements, tooling & features to help us get there.
You’ll conduct research, interviews, and user feedback sessions
You'll review qualitative and quantitative data and build businesses cases
You’ll develop personas, write stories, and create wireframes
You’ll lead planning sessions, manage sprints, and perform retrospectives
You’ll take on specific delivery requirements and solve problems
You’ll design, you’ll build, and you’ll ship product
You should join us if
You have empathy for customer needs, but can also consider technical constraints and business goals
You have at least 3-5 years of product experience, ideally working with a top-tier tech company or digital agency
Your vision and your strong sense for details help to continually raise the bar of quality product
You have a research centric, design driven and detail oriented mindset
You have an incredible amount of drive, integrity, and passion for our mission
The nuts and bolts:
You must be comfortable with moving quickly from scoping and research to prototyping and shipping
Great communication skills whether it be face to face, through video, phone, or email

197,Data Quality Manager,London,"Senior PR Manager, Business",-1,"We're looking for a confident, creative PR superstar with a demonstrated background in B2B communications.

You'll help us grow by embedding yourself in the TransferWise for Business team to truly understand the product and its customers, and thereby maximise the news pipeline in the UK and across Europe. You'll be comfortable creating narratives and news to capture the attention of all types of businesses, from entrepreneurs, freelancers and small businesses to scale-ups and larger enterprises, as well as delivering product announcements and partnership news. You'll be hands on, delivering news yourself (as opposed to via an agency), as well as acting as a conduit for stories to global PR managers as appropriate. Management experience is needed as you'll also be expected to grow and manage a team over time.

You should be a creative writer with a knack for untangling and explaining complex business products and developments in an easy to understand and relatable manner, and own a black book of press contacts in the small business trade, enterprise and national business media. You need to be comfortable with ambiguity and working in a fast paced environment with an experienced team of cross-functional stakeholders.

A bit about the job:


There are three key areas you will work on:

1. Owning Business Product Communications in UK and Europe

Embedding yourself within the Business product team to own the news flow as our product grows. You'll run the comms for product developments and new client announcements, as well as TransferWise's commentary on business industry news and developments. You'll be comfortable working with and developing specialist spokespeople such as our Head of TransferWise for Business, as well as expert product managers. You'll understand how to take a creative approach to make the seemingly mundane a hot news topic.

2. Creating News to Capture the Business Audience

Developing creative communications to build awareness of TransferWise with influential business media, as well as making TransferWise part of the wider business conversation through news hijacking and events. You'll feel comfortable putting together a six month creative PR plan to sustain news coverage, with your ideas extending way beyond safe YouGov surveys and forward features - see TransferWise's 20 under 20 programme for inspiration.

3. Supporting Business Product Communications Globally

As the only member of the PR team concentrating solely on the Business product, you'll act as a conduit for the team's stories globally. While you'll be most hands-on in the European market, you'll also be happy to support local country PR managers worldwide with your product knowledge.

What will you need?
Solid, varied experience of working in B2B communications. This could be in-house at a startup or bigger company, or in a PR agency. Experience of working with tech or fintech firms is a plus but not a necessity.
Proven ability to understand and simplify complex information. The details of TransferWise for Business partnerships vary by client size and type, and require a precise comms eye.
Innate understanding of what makes a good story for business media and how to secure great quality media coverage - along with existing media relationships in the UK as a minimum.
An ability to work proactively and independently in a fast-paced, high-growth company. You have a hands-on approach and can get results whether you're working independently or as part of the wider PR team. We get it done.
Outstanding planning and organisational skills with proven experience of strategic coordination of people, information, diary management and relationships.
A genuine, enthusiastic interest in our mission and developing and communicating great ideas to make financial services fairer for the business community.
The ability to scrutinise complex and technical data. You'll be able to understand and analyse complex concepts and turn them into simple and compelling messages.
Excellent written and spoken English.
Ideally, proficiency in a second European language.
What you'll get:


A front row seat at one of the hottest technology companies in the world and a chance to truly be a part of something great and challenging.

It goes without saying that you'll be a part of a fun, friendly atmosphere, with plenty of opportunities to grow personally and professionally.

Who we are:


TransferWise was founded in 2011 with a clear mission: money without borders. We're helping people and businesses send and receive any currency effortlessly - whenever, wherever - and making the world a bit better by helping to make the financial system fair.

We're currently 2,000 people strong across 13 global offices and our customers use TransferWise to transfer billions of dollars every month. TransferWise for Business is a fundamental part of this growth.

We're looking for a PR Manager to join our established Europe-wide comms team, building PR for our business product in the region. You'll be the first PR Manager dedicated solely to this product, working closely with the TransferWise for Business team, as well as local country PR Managers. You'll be based in our London office and report into our Head of PR for EMEA.

What it's really like to work here?


At TransferWise, we do things a bit differently. There's no corporate nonsense and no old-fashioned hierarchy. Instead, we work in self-sufficient, autonomous teams. Each team picks the problems they want to solve and does it - so there's no micro-management or people telling you what to do. You will get tons of guidance and support from talented, super-smart colleagues from all over TransferWise.

The way we work doesn't suit everyone. But, if freedom, autonomy, and head-scratching professional challenges rock your world, we could be a match made in heaven.

Due to expansion plans of a Medical Devices company based around Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, we are looking for an experienced Quality Manager who will be able to establish a QMS from scratch, specifically to ISO 13485 standards.

You will also be creating and managing technical files for a number of Medical Devices lines for Class I, Class IIa and Class IIb Medical Devices. This is a unique role that will allow you to split your role from being in the office and working from home, however this split will need to be agreed between yourself and the company to make sure you still have the support you need to be successful.

This is not a Quality Manager role where you will be leading a team, you will be providing all of the Quality Assurance duties yourself. As the company grows there may be new roles that will report into you, but this is not going to happen quickly. So, if you are not happy working on the quality duties yourself, this is not the role for you.

Apart from having a Quality Assurance, to ISO 13485 standards, background it would also be highly advantageous if you have a good understanding of Regulatory Affairs too.

Part of your role will be working alongside the manufacturing teams for these medical devices, due to this it would be highly beneficial if your Medical Devices Quality Assurance experience came from a Quality Engineering background, however this is not essential.

You will be rewarded with an excellent starting salary, end of year bonuses, health insurance and other benefits.

I expect a lot of interest in this role and expect the organisation to move quickly with their hire, so if you are interested in this role I suggest you make an application now or risk missing out.

NHS England and NHS Improvement came together on 1 April 2019 as a new single organisation. The NHS Long Term Plan focuses on delivering integrated care to patients at the local level and we can best support the NHS to deliver this as a single integrated organisation.

At the NHS, we are reminded every day of how important life is. As a flexible working friendly organisation, we want to be sure that you can work in a way that is best for us and for our patients, and for you. Speak to us about how we might be able to accommodate a flexible working arrangement whether that’s job share, part time or another flexible pattern. In addition, although the role advertised may have an ‘home’ office base indicated, we remain committed to supporting flexibility around workplace locations. If it works for the service, we will do our best to make it work for you.

Our new operating model represents a strong shift to regional delivery supported by expert corporate teams. Local health systems are supported by our integrated regional teams who play a major leadership role in the geographies they manage.

We are jointly committed to creating and maintaining a fair and supportive working environment and culture, where contributions are fully recognised and valued by all and staff feel empowered to carry out their duties to the best of their abilities. As employers we are committed to promoting and protecting the physical and mental health and well-being of all our staff. This underpins our values as set out in the NHS Constitution, supports us to be an Employer of Choice and ultimately enables our employees to support the effective care of our patients.

Based in Skipton House (London), the Provider Development directorate works with regional teams, local health systems and the provider sector to ensure that we have strong and successful providers, working collaboratively within strong and successful systems, in the best interests of local patients, populations and staff. Provider policy sits within this directorate.

We are a friendly team responsible for developing evidence-based advice and recommendations on high profile, important issues to support NHS England and NHS Improvement and the provider sector to make decisions that improve the delivery of care.

Our team looks beyond the headline questions to understand the real issues behind them, drawing on multiple sources of information on the provider sector and our knowledge of the policy and regulatory landscape. We use a range of structured tools to tackle each issue and engage widely to understand different perspectives and move thinking forward.

Our current work programme covers a broad range of high profile and interesting areas, including:

delivery of NHS long term plan commitments to support small rural acute providers and facilitate provider collaboration with systems
deep dive reviews into important issues facing providers in response to Covid-19 that fall at the interface between national policy and operational delivery
policy development and advise on providing-facing issues, including the NHS oversight framework, legislation, independent provider regulation and policy.

The role of the Senior Manager is to support, and lead as appropriate, the design and delivery of major policy and strategy projects, leading and delivering workstreams and managing stakeholders at all levels internally and externally.

This role involves:

owning the development of policy workstreams to support the development of the provider landscape and policy across NHS England and NHS Improvement.
delivering key strategic projects spanning the themes of oversight and improvement, the use of regulatory levers including competition and procurement, driving improvement in quality, integrated and new models of care and efficiency and productivity in the NHS.
developing policy and strategy for Provider Development and supporting decision makers within the organisation.
working collaboratively with national health and care bodies, including the government, and the sector itself.

In the National Security and Defence sector, a unique opportunity exists to impact high stakes real-world outcomes by enabling decision makers to explore, interact and experiment with rich simulations of interconnected real world systems – what we refer to as a single synthetic environment.

Synthetic environments give decision makers a constantly improving picture on how to best prepare for crises and threats.

Our Purpose

To make a more open land market to empower the next generation of property developers to build the homes (& places) we need for an ever growing and diverse population

“Like all great tech companies, we started with a problem.

Andrew (an east-London, quasi-hipster software engineer) wanted to build a house. And I (Jonny, a Geordie, ex-town planner turned software developer) knew the pain of the property industry systems he’d need to use to build that house.

We both knew that fixing those systems – making it easier to access that data – would help a whole load of people.

And thus LandTech was born – an ecosystem helping to make the entire house building process more efficient.

We started with LandInsight, the hugely successful (and multi-award-winning) site-sourcing platform. Then we added LandEnhance to help get planning permission, and LandFund to help secure funding.

But, not content to just be the fastest-growing PropTech company in the UK, we’re now heading international. Because all those problems we’re fixing aren’t just UK problems – they’re worldwide.

We’re helping to build more houses. Better houses. Plus the roads, schools, hospitals, and gyms to go with them.

Help us make that happen” - CEO/Co-Founder, Jonny Britton

Some achievements & awards so far:
Top 10 SaaS Companies to work for - Sales Confidence, 2018 & 2019
Excellence in People Development - PropTech, 2018

Department Purpose

The Product team at LandTech is a diverse mix of Designers and Product Managers who share some core values. We’re curious, we have a passion for deeply understanding our users’ needs and we’re determined to deliver high quality user experiences.

We do a lot of research to figure out what matters to our users, determine which problems we want to solve and in what order. Once we’ve homed in on a problem we work collaboratively to design and test the solution, build it and launch. We’re growing quickly so there’s always exciting new projects in the pipeline.
