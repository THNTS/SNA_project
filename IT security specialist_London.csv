#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

We’re looking for a seasoned design research professional to take our design research practice in Defence and Security on to the next level. You’ll have 3-5 years’ experience in design research, in any industry (though we have a preference for prior experience of Defence and Security).

132,IT security specialist,London,Energy and Security Analysts,-1,"We are looking for a number of professional analysts to join the team. The roles are open to badged Government Operational Researchers, Statisticians, Economists or Social Researchers, OR those who can demonstrate the relevant knowledge and experience to meet the professional membership requirements at Grade 7 level (more details provided under “Person Specification”).

International energy trading and offshore networks

In this role, you will be responsible for building the evidence base to support policy decisions about how we trade electricity and gas with Europe. Your modelling of the energy system and appraisal of the different options for future trade will inform both our negotiations with the EU as well any legislative changes which follow. As we establish a new energy trading relationship with the EU and form new trade agreements with non-EU countries, you will lead our analysis on the role that interconnectors – the undersea cables through which we trade electricity with other countries – will play as we move towards a decarbonised and flexible power system.
Alongside this, you will be responsible for building the evidence base to inform policy decisions about the way that our offshore electricity networks are developed. This is an increasingly important area of focus as the UK aims to quadruple its offshore wind capacity over the next 10 years.

Gas decarbonisation

The way we use gas at the moment – for heating, industry and power generation – will need to change as part of meeting our decarbonisation goals. We are expecting the use of natural gas to decline as electricity takes over in some areas, whilst hydrogen and green gas will play a growing role alongside.
In this role, you will be responsible for building the evidence base to inform how we decarbonise the gas system, with a particular focus on understanding the impacts on gas networks, security of supply and market structures.
Additionally, Net Zero will require the UK’s oil and gas industry to change. An additional part of this role is to support the industry’s transition, considering the impacts on jobs, infrastructure and the changing supply and demand of fossil fuels out to 2050.
This is an emerging work area in BEIS which will add to a growing programme of work on our Net Zero gas strategy.

CfDs

Contracts for Difference (CfDs) are the Government’s flagship policy and delivery mechanism to meet our renewables ambitions and ultimately contribute to our net zero target. The contracts are determined by a series of auctions that have a number of design parameters that need to be developed through robust analysis to meet policy objectives and provide value for money.
This post is critical to successful delivery of those auctions to make sure that we get the renewable electricity generation that we need. In this role you will be responsible for leading a policy facing analyst team to develop the evidence base, input into the auction design and articulate the trade-offs of different choices.
This is a challenging role that will contribute to a high profile policy area with critical delivery milestones in the next 12 months.

Electricity systems modelling

This is a key post for BEIS, working on the department’s model of the GB power market, to ensure the delivery of robust and influential analysis. Achieving net zero by 2050 is likely to rely on electrification of a range of sectors, making analysis of the electricity market key to understanding the overall trajectory of decarbonisation.
Our main modelling tool, the Dynamic Dispatch Model, is used to project generation and investment decisions. The timescale of analysis ranges from the next few years (to inform decisions over e.g. carbon pricing or security of supply) out to strategic analysis of 2050 and beyond. The model underpins all major electricity policy decisions, and its importance is recognised by senior colleagues, ministers, other government departments and industry.
You will be working as part of a multi-disciplinary team, taking responsibility for updating and developing parts of the model, and delivering analysis on a range of different policy areas.

Nuclear policy analyst

The UK’s current nuclear fleet forms an essential part of a diverse energy mix, providing reliable and carbon-free electricity generation. Nuclear policy areas range from new nuclear builds, disposal of nuclear waste, decommissioning of plants at the end of their life, protecting the UK’s civil nuclear infrastructure, exploring the potential of new nuclear technologies and more!
This role sits within the analytical team supporting the two nuclear directorates within BEIS and provides an excellent opportunity to be involved in the delivery of legislation over a range of areas.
You will work as part of a multi-disciplinary team and be involved with longer-term projects, as well as quick turnaround ad hoc requests for data and analysis, in a role that will involve working with senior policy officials and analysts within BEIS as well as other public bodies and Government Departments.
Responsibilities
In all cases, the roles will provide opportunities to:
use existing models and analytical tools to build the evidence base and inform thinking in relation to the UK energy system;
lead analytical work programmes, including developing new analysis and tools – e.g. through developing novel methods or procuring external research and consultancy;
work with a range of partners, such as legal, commercial and technical specialists from within the Department, across other Government departments as well as external organisations such as Ofgem and National Grid; and
oversee and develop junior analysts.

Person specification:

We are seeking someone with an enthusiasm for developing and using analysis to help influence policy decisions.

Essential criteria:

A proven track-record of developing and overseeing high-quality and influential analysis, such as data analysis, modelling, cost-benefit analysis, option appraisals, quantitative research or evaluation.

About the job
Summary
Do you want to help the UK reach its climate change goals? Do you have a passion for using evidence to underpin policy making? We want enthusiastic professional analysts to join our Energy and Security Analysis team, working on issues that have a real impact on everyone’s everyday lives.

In 2019, the Government set an ambitious target for the UK to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. To help us reach that target we need to make decisions now about the way we generate and use energy in the future, as well as ensuring that our energy system is both affordable and secure. Those decisions need to be underpinned and informed by high quality analysis. In the Energy Security and Analysis team, we play a fundamental role throughout the policy cycle, from development through to implementation and evaluation. The team of around 50 multidisciplinary analysts work together using a range of techniques including modelling, appraisal, evaluation and data management, to help set the direction of policy. We are a friendly and encouraging team dedicated to professional development, equality and diversity, and offering an accommodating working environment. Many people in the team have flexible working arrangements, including part time and compressed hours

We will ensure that individuals with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodation to participate in the job application or interview process, to perform crucial job functions, and to receive other benefits and privileges of employment. Please contact us to request accommodation.
Job description
We are looking for a number of professional analysts to join the team. The roles are open to badged Government Operational Researchers, Statisticians, Economists or Social Researchers, OR those who can demonstrate the relevant knowledge and experience to meet the professional membership requirements at Grade 7 level (more details provided under “Person Specification”).

International energy trading and offshore networks

In this role, you will be responsible for building the evidence base to support policy decisions about how we trade electricity and gas with Europe. Your modelling of the energy system and appraisal of the different options for future trade will inform both our negotiations with the EU as well any legislative changes which follow. As we establish a new energy trading relationship with the EU and form new trade agreements with non-EU countries, you will lead our analysis on the role that interconnectors – the undersea cables through which we trade electricity with other countries – will play as we move towards a decarbonised and flexible power system.
Alongside this, you will be responsible for building the evidence base to inform policy decisions about the way that our offshore electricity networks are developed. This is an increasingly important area of focus as the UK aims to quadruple its offshore wind capacity over the next 10 years.

Gas decarbonisation

The way we use gas at the moment – for heating, industry and power generation – will need to change as part of meeting our decarbonisation goals. We are expecting the use of natural gas to decline as electricity takes over in some areas, whilst hydrogen and green gas will play a growing role alongside.
In this role, you will be responsible for building the evidence base to inform how we decarbonise the gas system, with a particular focus on understanding the impacts on gas networks, security of supply and market structures.
Additionally, Net Zero will require the UK’s oil and gas industry to change. An additional part of this role is to support the industry’s transition, considering the impacts on jobs, infrastructure and the changing supply and demand of fossil fuels out to 2050.
This is an emerging work area in BEIS which will add to a growing programme of work on our Net Zero gas strategy.

CfDs

Contracts for Difference (CfDs) are the Government’s flagship policy and delivery mechanism to meet our renewables ambitions and ultimately contribute to our net zero target. The contracts are determined by a series of auctions that have a number of design parameters that need to be developed through robust analysis to meet policy objectives and provide value for money.
This post is critical to successful delivery of those auctions to make sure that we get the renewable electricity generation that we need. In this role you will be responsible for leading a policy facing analyst team to develop the evidence base, input into the auction design and articulate the trade-offs of different choices.
This is a challenging role that will contribute to a high profile policy area with critical delivery milestones in the next 12 months.

Electricity systems modelling

This is a key post for BEIS, working on the department’s model of the GB power market, to ensure the delivery of robust and influential analysis. Achieving net zero by 2050 is likely to rely on electrification of a range of sectors, making analysis of the electricity market key to understanding the overall trajectory of decarbonisation.
Our main modelling tool, the Dynamic Dispatch Model, is used to project generation and investment decisions. The timescale of analysis ranges from the next few years (to inform decisions over e.g. carbon pricing or security of supply) out to strategic analysis of 2050 and beyond. The model underpins all major electricity policy decisions, and its importance is recognised by senior colleagues, ministers, other government departments and industry.
You will be working as part of a multi-disciplinary team, taking responsibility for updating and developing parts of the model, and delivering analysis on a range of different policy areas.

Nuclear policy analyst

The UK’s current nuclear fleet forms an essential part of a diverse energy mix, providing reliable and carbon-free electricity generation. Nuclear policy areas range from new nuclear builds, disposal of nuclear waste, decommissioning of plants at the end of their life, protecting the UK’s civil nuclear infrastructure, exploring the potential of new nuclear technologies and more!
This role sits within the analytical team supporting the two nuclear directorates within BEIS and provides an excellent opportunity to be involved in the delivery of legislation over a range of areas.
You will work as part of a multi-disciplinary team and be involved with longer-term projects, as well as quick turnaround ad hoc requests for data and analysis, in a role that will involve working with senior policy officials and analysts within BEIS as well as other public bodies and Government Departments.

Responsibilities
In all cases, the roles will provide opportunities to:
• use existing models and analytical tools to build the evidence base and inform thinking in relation to the UK energy system;
• lead analytical work programmes, including developing new analysis and tools – e.g. through developing novel methods or procuring external research and consultancy;
• work with a range of partners, such as legal, commercial and technical specialists from within the Department, across other Government departments as well as external organisations such as Ofgem and National Grid; and
• oversee and develop junior analysts.

Person specification:

We are seeking someone with an enthusiasm for developing and using analysis to help influence policy decisions.

Essential criteria:

• A proven track-record of developing and overseeing high-quality and influential analysis, such as data analysis, modelling, cost-benefit analysis, option appraisals, quantitative research or evaluation.

• Proven leadership and organisational skills to manage analytical workstreams and ensure delivery of both fast-paced work and longer-term projects.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.)

Recruitment Privacy Notice
As part of any recruitment process, Nagwa collects and processes personal data relating to job applicants. Nagwa is committed to being transparent about how it collects and uses that data and to meeting its data protection obligations.

What information does Nagwa collect?

Nagwa collects a range of information about you. This includes:
your name, address and contact details, including email address and telephone number;
details of your qualifications, skills, experience and employment history;
information about the date you applied, email correspondence, writing sample assessment, comments and rating;
whether or not you have a disability for which Nagwa needs to make reasonable adjustments during the recruitment process; and
information about your entitlement to work in the UK.
Nagwa collects this information in a variety of ways. For example, data might be contained in application forms, CVs or resumes, obtained from your passport or other identity documents, or collected through interviews or other forms of assessment, including online tests.

Nagwa will also collect personal data about you from third parties, such as references supplied by former employers, information from employment background check providers and information from criminal records checks. Nagwa will seek information from third parties only once a job offer to you has been made and will inform you that it is doing so.

Data will be stored in a range of different places, including on your application record, in HR management systems and on other IT systems (including email).

Why does Nagwa process personal data?

Nagwa needs to process data to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with you. It also needs to process your data to enter into a contract with you.

In some cases, Nagwa needs to process data to ensure that it is complying with its legal obligations. For example, it is required to check a successful applicant's eligibility to work in the UK before employment starts.

Nagwa has a legitimate interest in processing personal data during the recruitment process and for keeping records of the process. Processing data from job applicants allows Nagwa to manage the recruitment process, assess and confirm a candidate's suitability for employment and decide to whom to offer a job. Nagwa may also need to process data from job applicants to respond to and defend against legal claims.

Where Nagwa relies on legitimate interests as a reason for processing data, it has considered whether or not those interests are overridden by the rights and freedoms of employees or workers and has concluded that they are not.

Nagwa processes health information if it needs to make reasonable adjustments to the recruitment process for candidates who have a disability. This is to carry out its obligations and exercise specific rights in relation to employment.

Where Nagwa processes other special categories of data, such as information about ethnic origin, sexual orientation, health or religion or belief, this is for equal opportunities monitoring purposes.

For some roles, Nagwa is obliged to seek information about criminal convictions and offences. Where Nagwa seeks this information, it does so because it is necessary for it to carry out its obligations and exercise specific rights in relation to employment.

Nagwa will not use your data for any purpose other than the recruitment exercise for which you have applied.

If your application is unsuccessful, Nagwa may keep your personal data on file in case there are future employment opportunities for which you may be suited. Nagwa will ask for your consent before it keeps your data for this purpose and you are free to withdraw your consent at any time.

Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

In the event that a dispute arises with regards to the international transfer of data, you agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter.

Who has access to data?

Your information will be shared internally (within Nagwa Technologies) for the purposes of the recruitment exercise. This includes members of the HR and recruitment team, interviewers involved in the recruitment process, managers in the business area with a vacancy and IT staff if access to the data is necessary for the performance of their roles.

Nagwa will not share your data with third parties other than those detailed above, unless your application for employment is successful and it makes you an offer of employment. Nagwa will then share your data with former employers to obtain references for you, employment background check providers to obtain necessary background checks and the Disclosure and Barring Service to obtain necessary criminal records checks, where appropriate.

How does Nagwa protect data?

Nagwa takes the security of your data seriously. It has internal policies and controls in place to ensure that your data is not lost, accidentally destroyed, misused or disclosed, and is not accessed except by our employees in the proper performance of their duties. Nagwa uses encryption, secure socket layer, firewall, password protection, and other physical and logical security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to data. Nagwa also places internal restrictions on who in the company may access data to help prevent unauthorized access to such information.

For how long does Nagwa keep data?

If your application for employment is unsuccessful, Nagwa will hold your data on file for 6 months after the end of the relevant recruitment process. If you agree to allow Nagwa to keep your personal data on file, Nagwa will hold your data on file for 6 months for consideration for future employment opportunities. At the end of that period, your data is deleted or destroyed.

If your application for employment is successful, personal data gathered during the recruitment process will be transferred to your personnel file and retained during your employment. The periods for which your data will be held will be provided to you in a new privacy notice.

Your rights

As a data subject, you have a number of rights. You can:
access and obtain a copy of your data on request;
require Nagwa to change incorrect or incomplete data;
require Nagwa to delete or stop processing your data, for example where the data is no longer necessary for the purposes of processing;
object to the processing of your data where Nagwa is relying on its legitimate interests as the legal ground for processing; and
ask Nagwa to stop processing data for a period if data is inaccurate or there is a dispute about whether or not your interests override Nagwa's legitimate grounds for processing data.
If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please email Paula Dixon at paula.dixon@nagwa.com. You can make a subject access request by completing Nagwa's form for making a subject access request.

If you believe that Nagwa has not complied with your data protection rights, you can complain to the Information Commissioner.

You are under no statutory or contractual obligation to provide data to Nagwa during the recruitment process. However, if you do not provide the information, Nagwa may not be able to process your application properly or at all.

You are under no obligation to provide information for equal opportunities monitoring purposes and there are no consequences for your application if you choose not to provide such information.
