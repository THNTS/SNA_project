3,Computer programmer,London,Graduate Development Programme,-1,"Ordnance Survey (OS) provides national mapping services for Great Britain and is world-leading provider of geospatial solutions.

OS location data and expertise has helped governments make smarter decisions, businesses gain valuable data insight, and everyone experience the world outside for over 225 years.

Ordnance Survey Graduate Development Programme

Ordnance Survey (OS) provides national mapping services for Great Britain and is world-leading provider of geospatial solutions.

OS location data and expertise has helped governments make smarter decisions, businesses gain valuable data insight, and everyone experience the world outside for over 225 years.

What do we do and why?

Population growth, climate change, and disruptive technology are impacting every nation. Geospatial data is helping to solve the complex problems of a changing world. We’re exploring how business can use location data more intelligently, through analytics, joining multiple data sources, data integration, and sharing platforms or environments. We are working at the heart of making national data connected and valuable, providing the framework for a wide range of public and commercial services and helping the development of a ‘smarter’ more connected world. We’re also leading machine-to-machine use of data at a level of detail never before seen in national mapping agencies.

Working with countries all over the world, our expertise and capability supports the sustainable development and delivery of efficient public services – improving quality of life for millions of people. Our advisory services work with organisations, governments and other geospatial bodies and partners to improve policy making and increase geospatial capabilities demonstrating how GB is using the same approach to geospatial data and standards to save millions of pounds per year; reduce carbon emissions; make the best possible evidence-based decisions; deliver effective public services and plan new developments.

How do we do it?

Every day, our people use their world-class skills to deliver innovative solutions and grow our service offer. Innovation is at the heart of everything we do, and we not only operate at the cutting edge of collecting, managing and sharing data we seek new and relevant ways to solve real world challenges through the use of location based, big data and services.

Our people are experts. Along with surveyors and data visualisation experts, our teams include data analysts, research and data scientists, developers and engineers; our technical relationship consultants and technical product managers are working alongside customers every day in GB and across the world to solve customer problems with our data and services. Our innovators are exploring how Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and gamification can bring location data to life. Meanwhile, our thought leaders are re-imagining and re-thinking the use of geospatial on a global stage, improving lives everywhere.

We want to ensure we continue to grow our unique geospatial capability through a graduate programme that will bring together your enthusiasm for making a difference with our expertise and passion for continuing our development as the world’s most trusted geospatial partner.

What will I be doing as a graduate at OS?

Our graduate programme will provide you with the opportunities to develop to be our future Technical experts, consultants and future leaders. As part of a team, you will be working on projects and activities that build on your core technical expertise, gaining experience and exposure to our full end to end data capture, processing, analysis and solutions business.

During the programme, you will be embedded in our geospatial teams working through a number of placements – for some, this may be centred around a specific geo data science technical capability, while others may have a broader series of placements ranging from geospatial operations to data analysis and customer engagement. Your programme may also include the opportunity to spend time with some of our geospatial partners within the UK, for example in wider Government bodies or with our commercial partners. As you develop and grow your technical expertise, we will work together to identify where your skills and aspirations lie.

Some of the projects you may be involved with include:

OS OpenData: We believe easy-to-access data is a catalyst for fresh thinking. We’re supporting communities to use our data, accelerating new technologies and businesses, and enabling the Internet of Things. It underpins a range of applications, while promoting government transparency & accountability and encouraging greater use of geographic information.

Smart Cities: To build communities with improved quality of life – better housing, air and transport – decision-makers need an accurate understanding of place. With location data at the core, we can explore how to use emerging technologies to meet the complex and interconnected needs of society. For example, sharing vehicle location and movement data can help improve not just passenger journeys, but also safety, air quality and traffic flow.

Housing & Transport: We support the government’s plans to boost availability of land in the right places for homes, and to ensure that better use is made of underused land in towns and cities. As well as detailed, accurate topography, our data also provides information about addresses; roads; sites of interest; greenspaces; postcode units and more.

Energy & Infrastructure: Our data, services and consultancy help energy and infrastructure organisations plan, build, manage and maintain networks more effectively by understanding the landscape in detail and integrating data. Electricity, gas, water and telecommunications sectors can find out in-depth information about a road and the environment, so they can plan exactly where to install new assets or carry out underground maintenance.

E-CAVE: Enabling Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Environments (E-CAVE) research project to design the frameworks, data and resources for CAV data exchange. E-CAVE will enable real-time vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) data sharing, using open standards and architecture.

Our graduate programme is about providing you on the job learning and development throughout the programme to enable you to grow your technical and professional skills. You work on real life projects, programmes and business challenges. Our graduate scheme provides opportunities to develop your core technical expertise; to be our future technical experts, consultants and leaders.

Where will I be based?

During the development programme you will be based primarily at our Headquarters in Southampton, but your project work may see you working throughout the UK (and potentially internationally) but at the moment due to the current circumstances, most of our employees are working from home.

Background
The postholder will be a key researcher in an MRC-funded project to study the mechanisms of response and resistance to novel epigenetic therapies in Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML). This position will be supervised by Dr Lynn Quek, based in King's College London's Denmark Hill Campus.
AML is an aggressive bone marrow cancer which is incurable in the majority of patients. Our focus is to improve our understanding this disease with an ultimate aim to translate this knowledge to better treatments for patients. The focus of our research is to better understand the biology of leukaemia propagating cells in patient-derived AML which are mutated in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 genes. This important group of AMLs account for 20-30% of all AMLs.
Inhibitors of mutant IDH enzymes such as Ivosidenib and Enasidenib have recently been developed and FDA-approved to treat IDH-mutant AML. We have shown that IDH inhibitors restore blood function in AML patients by inducing differentiation of leukaemic cells previously unable to differentiate normally into mature blood cells (Amatangelo et al. Blood, 2017). We recently described the clonal dynamics of response and resistance to IDH inhibitor therapy in patients and demonstrated the impact of clonal heterogeneity on the function of AML cells in vivo (Quek et al. Nature Medicine, 2018).
We are looking for an ambitious research scientist with excellent computational skills and experience, who takes pride in performing scientific work to high technical standards. The successful candidate will have excellent organisation skills, who can demonstrate that (s)he is ready to take on new challenges. This postholder will be a key member of a team to study the metabolic and epigenetic events which underlie cell fate decisions in human patient IDH-mutant AML cells treated with IDH inhibitors, and be involved in analysis of clinical trial data.
This work requires expertise in analysis NGS data including WES, bulk and single cell RNA-seq and single cell ATAC-seq. Knowledge of methylation-seq would be an advantage. Previous experience of medical statistics and analysis of clinical data is desirable. The candidate should have a good understanding of laboratory techniques used to study haematopoiesis and leukaemia, including multi-omics and flow cytometry. The postholder will be expected to be self-driven in developing new skills. The postholder may be asked to co-supervise junior members of team and provide training in computational methods.
We are able to offer wider support and networking with computational teams within our network of collaborative research groups within KCL.
The successful candidate will have a good track record in Haematology research, demonstrate self-motivation, independent critical thinking, flexibility and good teamwork. This post will be ideal for a computational scientist who has a background in Clinical Haemato-oncology, especially in myeloid malignancies and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. There may be opportunities for additional clinical work that would attract additional clinical pay supplements (e.g. supporting outpatient clinics and clinical trials activity) for the suitably qualified individual.
Dr Quek is especially interested in helping promising researchers develop their career and will suit an early career clinical academic looking for post-doctoral experience prior to application for a post-doctoral intermediate research fellowship. This project will provide excellent scientific training, working in an area that has direct relevance to patient care.
This post will be offered as a full-time, fixed term contract for 24 months.

Cyber Associate Programme
It only takes one successful attack to devastate a company’s financial performance, brand — and reputation. And in the current cyber climate, it’s not a case of if an attack will happen, but when. Resilient companies recognise this new normal and stay one step ahead to protect themselves, their customers, partners and vendors against devastating attacks. That’s where you come in.

Aon’s cyber solutions cyber associate programme is a twelve-month rotational programme, running from September each year. We immerse our graduates in projects covering all key areas of information security, including:
Digital forensics and investigations
Penetration testing
Incident response (reactively working with an organisation in response to a cyber attack)
eDiscovery (helping companies interrogate data for key information and facts, or make disclosures)
Proactive security (spotting vulnerabilities and defending organisations against adversaries)

You’ll have exposure to several other areas of our business, to give you a holistic understanding of Aon. We’ll also give you the chance to work on a range of real-world security situations. One day you might be chasing malicious hackers through a client’s network; the next, analysing messaging apps on an iPhone. Our clients span all sorts of industries too, including financial services, healthcare, retail, hospitality, technology and communications, entertainment and more.

When joining us for the graduate programme, you’ll become a vital part of Aon’s cyber solutions team. What’s more, once you’ve completed the programme, it’s expected that you’ll be assigned a permanent role with us.

Locations:
London
Manchester

Your work with us:
Our graduate programme gives you the rare chance to work across four specialisations before deciding where you want to grow your career. Our graduates work side-by-side with our existing employees across our global offices.

You’ll work across a range of client services, including:

Investigations and response: digital forensics and incident response, eDiscovery and intelligence
Recover, preserve and analyse digital evidence in one of our twelve cutting-edge forensic laboratories
Uncover computer-enabled theft, leaks of confidential business information, mass or targeted deletions
Apply forensic analysis techniques to reconstruct events on computers and phones, and surface evidence in civil and criminal investigations
Respond to data breaches, APT attacks, cyber extortion, malicious code, botnets, economic espionage, ransomware and other cyber incidents
Hunt for indicators of compromise and other malicious activity and vulnerabilities within an environment, and analyse irregular network traffic
Understand methods used by criminals, using this knowledge to help guide investigations and put preventative solutions in place
Process large and/or complex data sets to extract their content and file information, to make the data searchable and reviewable in depth and at scale

Proactive security advisory and penetration testing
Monitor environments to identify and prioritise threats from cyber criminals
Perform technical, information, application and physical security risk assessments
Conduct cyber threat simulations and recommend solutions to secure vulnerabilities
Perform penetration testing on web and mobile applications, as well as network penetration testing (external and internal) to include vulnerability exploitation and pivoting to gain remote system access
Conduct application source code review
Complete vulnerability research and exploit development

Training and certification:
From the very start of the programme, you’ll be immersed in learning activities that’ll boost your business and client management skills and equip you with technical qualifications.

The graduate programme kicks off with a one-week group training and orientation, including soft skills immersion, team building and technical exercises.

Fixed-term: The funds for this post are available for 3 years.
The Project
Applications are invited for a Research Associate (PostDoc) to work on novel programmable hardware for application security to provide resilience to current and future attack techniques.
Our research group focuses on a number of approaches to increase performance and improve the reliability and security of applications. Recent work has developed The Guardian Council, a novel parallel architecture for security monitoring that detects security attacks as they occur, enabling evasive action to be taken. We have also developed a number of schemes for temporal memory safety (MarkUs, CHERIvoke, Cornucopia), to prevent use-after-free attacks in low-level code.
We are looking to complement our research in the field of programmable hardware security. We wish to further develop schemes for security monitoring in high-performance microprocessors, equipping our hardware with the ability to mitigate attacks in real time in addition to performing detection. The successful candidate will analyse programs and attack-detection schemes and develop novel hardware that can be programmed to carry out these defences by leveraging parallel execution.
Research Group *
Our group is a team of PostDocs and PhD students investigating performance, reliability and security in future many-core systems. The position is within the Computer Architecture Research Group at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. Collaboration with researchers at other universities and industry around the world is encouraged and there are strong links within the group with local companies.
Candidates *
We seek candidates with a strong background in Computer Science with an interest in computer architecture and security. Applicants should hold a PhD or have equivalent experience, though those who are close to submitting a PhD will be considered. Knowledge of a related area is not essential but would be advantageous. Candidates should provide evidence of relevant work, where possible, and must demonstrate a desire to perform internationally-leading research and to publish in the top conferences in the area.
This position can be filled by an appropriate candidate at research assistant or research associate level, depending on relevant qualifications and experience. Appointment at research associate level is dependent on having a PhD (or equivalent experience). Where a PhD has yet to be awarded the appointment will initially be made as a research assistant and amended to research associate when the PhD is awarded.

74,Computer programmer,London,Dynamics 365 Programme Manager,-1,"We have a number of exciting opportunities for talented and enthusiastic Graduate Programmers to join our exceptional development teams here at Frontier Developments in Cambridge. We are a growing studio and expect a significant proportion of that growth to come from graduate recruitment. We are therefore looking to hire more graduates with start dates in Spring/Summer 2020. Read below to find out more and apply on-line.
Why join Frontier as a Graduate Programmer?
We have a reputation for technological innovation. Our programmers get involved in all aspects of system architecture, design and implementation, bringing an extremely high standard of professionalism to the development of all our games. Programmers at all levels, fully contribute to a dynamic, creative and fun environment, working with advanced technology on the leading games consoles and cutting edge PCs.
As a Graduate Programmer at Frontier you will have the opportunity to quickly make an important contribution to the development and improvement of some of the industry’s biggest and most loved games, for example Elite Dangerous, Planet Coaster and Planet Zoo or the development of new games. We give our graduates interesting and challenging work from an early stage, but of course you will be supported along the way and have the opportunity work alongside and learn from our more experienced people. That’s why many of our graduates go on to develop their careers with us.
What graduate opportunities do you have?
We have a number of exciting opportunities in different areas for graduates to join our development teams. Our game teams are small enough to be flexible but large enough to create AAA games. Every game is different but a typical game might include 25 programmers and 55 other developers. We’ve developed our own game engine (COBRA), which provides a huge range of exciting programming challenges. We also have a team concentrating on technology shared between games that bring benefits across all our projects. Most of our Graduate Programmers usually specialise in one or two areas but programmers can and do move between areas. Check out our ‘Programming Application Guidance’ page for more information on the specialisms that our programmers have developed.
Qualifications, skills & experience
You’ll have a strong educational background including a good degree. Many of our graduates join us with degrees in a directly relevant subject e.g. Computer Science, Maths or Physics. However we are equally open to people from other degree disciplines with a strong coding element and who can demonstrate the skills and attributes we’re looking for.
Industry experience isn’t essential but passion and enthusiasm for developing amazing games are. Any experience developing games either in industry, as an intern, or in your own time will therefore certainly help set you apart from the crowd.
Technically you will obviously need to be capable of good code design. For more detail on the specific technical skills we look for check out the ‘Programmer Application Guidance’ page.
About you
Our programmers work at Frontier for the love of creating and providing our community of players with the games they love and the high quality playing experience they have come to expect from a Frontier game. We’re looking for graduates who share this passion and will relish that challenge.
Our teams are made up of some of the most skilled, driven and talented people in the industry and when they collaborate the results are outstanding. You will therefore need good communication and team working skills to allow you to collaborate effectively with colleagues from different teams.
Our teams are constantly reviewing each other’s work to ensure that what they deliver is of the highest standard; you’ll therefore need to be open to giving and receiving constructive feedback on a regular basis. Finally, we are looking for graduates who will take ownership and responsibility for their work. This means not only being well organised and able to plan and manage your own work but also contributing new ideas which will help us do things quicker, better or more efficiently; something that is encouraged at all levels in the studio.",3.7,"Mortimer Bell International Ltd

84,Computer programmer,London,"Post-doctoral Training Fellow, Single Cell Computational Genomics - Functional Genomics team",-1,"The Breast Cancer Now Toby Robins Research Centre at the ICR is the first centre in the UK entirely devoted to breast cancer research. Our goal is to advance research into the causes, diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. It is located in state-of-the-art laboratory space, with excellent core facilities and funding.

The Functional Genomics laboratory headed by Dr. Rachael Natrajan is a multidisciplinary laboratory with the mission to develop new treatment strategies for breast cancers resistant to standard of care therapies.The lab uses state of the art molecular profiling such as single cell sequencing and spatial genomic profiling on patient samples throughout disease progression to understand the molecular evolution of breast cancer and response to targeted therapies. Together with molecular barcoding strategies in patient derived models, mechanistic hypotheses are evaluated in vitro and in vivo and candidate biomarkers or therapeutic options are tested pre-clinically that informs the design of proof of concept clinical trials or drug discovery programmes. We have made novel advances into the understanding of genomic alterations and their impact on breast cancer in different contexts and how to target these effectively (including Maguire et al J. of Pathology 2015, PMID 25424858; Bajrami et al Cancer Res 2014, PMID: 24240700; Natrajan et al PLOS Medicine 2015).

The Bioinformatics Team uses statistical and machine learning approaches to analyse/ interpret genomics datasets from cancer cells, PDX/PDO models and patient studies. The team pursues hypothesis-driven research as well as data-mining of public cancer datasets to generate new hypothesis, which are subsequently tested in collaboration with the wet-lab scientists in the division. Our work has led to significant advances in both bioinformatics and understanding of breast cancer (including Haider et al. JCO PO 2020, DOI: 10.1200/PO.20.00016; Haider et al. Nat. Comms. 2018, PMID 30420699; Baxter et al. Nat. Comms. 2018, PMID 29531215). We are equipped with both freely available and in-house developed software and pipelines supporting our computational needs. Much of the computational work is carried out at the ICR’s High Performance Compute Cluster.
We are seeking a post-doctoral training fellow analytical scientist with experience in single cell bioinformatics to join the Breast Cancer Research Functional Genomics and Bioinformatics Groups. Our goal is to use single cell sequencing approaches to investigate the sub-clonal make up of treatment resistant breast cancers in order to identify new molecular markers and targetable pathways of breast cancer. Results will be validated by wet lab members within the team.
You will work as part of a team of inter-disciplinary data scientists who are experts in single cell genomic analysis, NGS-data analysis, machine learning and software development; and therefore offering unique learning opportunities. Your work will focus on the development and validation of hypotheses, dissecting genetic/genomic and transcriptomic assays to delineate driver genes and pathways of breast cancer. The work will include application of existing tools using in-house and publicly available datasets. These datasets will require strong analytical skills to perform integrated analysis and visualisation of complex multi-omic datasets. You will have opportunities to create/optimise computational pipelines and develop new methods for the analysis and interpretation of big data in breast cancer. You will work closely with experimental biologists and hence it is essential to be able to communicate your findings effectively to biologists and clinicians.

The postholder will work independently and as a part of a multi-disciplinary team of wet lab scientists and analytical scientists, to identify cancer causing aberrations and molecular markers using single cell and spatial genomic profiling of clinical samples and model systems and integrate these with in-house and publicly available high-throughput sequencing and clinical datasets. The identified targets will be used to guide clinical trials at the Breast Cancer Now Centre (ICR). The successful post holder will be involved in the design, analysis, interpretation and scientific writing of results for high impact journals.
Applicants should hold a PhD in bioinformatics/biostatistics/ computational biology, have experience in statistical programming and scripting, experience in analysis of next-generation sequencing data and must have a basic knowledge of biology.

This position is offered on a fixed term 18 month contract. Starting salary is in the range of £32,844* to £38,607 per annum inclusive based on previous postdoctoral experience.

Actuarial Consulting Pensions: Graduate Programme
Join Aon as an actuarial consulting pensions graduate, and discover how our global team of specialists help businesses make smart choices about their employees’ pensions — now, and into the future.

Right now, UK companies have more invested in pension schemes than the rest of Europe combined. But, has each individual company set aside enough to meet their pensions’ obligations in twenty, thirty or even forty years’ time?

As the market leader in actuarial consulting, at Aon we’re here to advise our clients on their defined pension schemes, helping them to manage the associated financial and operational risks. As an Aon graduate, you’ll work alongside the best and brightest in the industry, earning as you learn — what better way to launch your career?

Locations:
Birmingham
Bristol
Epsom
Farnborough
Glasgow
Leeds
London
Manchester
St Albans
Entry requirements:
Educated to degree level with a 2:1 or equivalent qualification in a numerate/semi-numerate discipline and a B or above in Maths A-level, or equivalent
Strong commercial awareness, lots of ambition and an enthusiastic approach are important
Applicants for the longevity modelling analyst roles (read on for more on these specialist roles) should also possess a strong mathematical capability, with experience in numerical modelling (e.g. with Excel/VBA, R, Matlab, C#, C++, .Net) beneficial but not essential
The role:
As an actuarial colleague, you’ll find that no two days in the office are the same. You’ll work on a range of client teams with colleagues who advise either the trustees managing the pension scheme, or the company that provides it.

Our aim is for you to develop into a trusted advisor for your clients as soon as possible. We’ll help you do this by developing both your technical and consulting skills — including your understanding of key calculations, communication techniques, project management and networking. Throughout your career with Aon, you’ll continually improve your commercial awareness and professionalism — which will help you grow into a successful consultant.

Responsibilities:
Regular assessment of the financial position of pension schemes
Identify and implement ways for trustees and companies to reduce the risks in relation to their schemes, including longevity risks, investment risks and inflation risk
Make calculations relating to the pension scheme for the company's financial accounts
Make calculations with respect to individual pension scheme members' benefits
Day-to-day management of the pension scheme
Estimate pension protection fund levies
Manage corporate transactions — i.e. when a merger or acquisition of companies takes place, the liabilities of the companies' pension schemes need to be taken into account in the deal
The final close-down of the schemes when risk is passed to a third party

You’ll be given opportunities to work on a range of projects, gaining early exposure to clients to support your development. You’ll also have the chance to be involved in one of our world-class specialist teams.

Specialist Team: Longevity Modelling:
Within our actuarial department, we have best-in-class specialist teams. One of these teams, the longevity modelling team, has graduate opportunities for 2020 based in Birmingham and Manchester.

Aon is the UK’s leading longevity risk adviser, helping pension planners, insurers and reinsurers understand how long their pensioners are likely to live and how variable this could be. This helps them decide how much money to set aside, and whether it makes sense to insure against the risk of increasing life expectancy.
The advice of our longevity modelling analysts underlies the largest risk hedging transactions executed to date in the UK and overseas. Join our team of expert analysts, and you’ll help to deliver the highest quality advice to our clients. In return, we’ll give you everything you need to become an expert yourself, with training on our modelling approaches, cutting-edge tools and computer programming techniques.

As a member of our longevity modelling team, your responsibilities will involve:
Supporting our market leading longevity modelling and providing advice, in relation to longevity deals (where we may be advising pension plans, their sponsors, insurers or reinsurers)
Developing our proprietary longevity modelling to maintain Aon's technical lead
Creating and maintaining the cashflow models that back large-scale longevity swaps
Supporting the wider Aon consulting population in relation to longevity
Building longevity expertise within the risk settlement group and the wider Aon group

This role is slightly different to the standard pensions consulting role – you'll be involved in more technical modelling work and helping to develop our internal models and analytical tools, as well as supporting the delivery of the advice we provide to our clients.

Training and Development:
At Aon, all roles include plenty of on-the-job experience. As a graduate, you’ll also get involved in technical and consulting workshops. These will give you the skills you need to provide innovative solutions that meet our clients' needs, as well as building your confidence and experience through proactively managing client relationships.

As your career progresses, you’ll have access to a variety of interactive training sessions — these are designed to supplement your experience, and help you develop into a skilled consultant.

We want you to be as successful as possible, so we’ll fully support your study towards professional qualification as a Fellow of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. To support you as you study for your exams, you’ll receive paid study leave, plus an extensive range of study and tuition materials.

After the graduate programme, what’s next?
Once you’ve completed the formal graduate programme, you’ll continue to receive lots of support at Aon. As well as the interactive training sessions we’ve mentioned above, you’ll have the chance to explore different career paths.

You may choose to specialise in advising trustee clients, or corporate pension scheme sponsors. There’s also the opportunity to join and develop a role in one of Aon's specialist teams, like the industry-leading risk settlement group.

Whichever route you choose, we’ll provide support and training at every step, giving you the tools you need to build an exciting career at Aon.",3.6,"Aon Corporation

Keep your head in the Cloud

If you think Capital One is just a credit card provider, think again.

In many ways, we're as much a technology business as a finance company. We pioneered the use of predictive modelling in this industry, and today we still look at credit the way tech companies look at everything – with a view to changing the way people live.

That’s how we make finance more human.

It’s why you’ll find Capital One an inspiring place to launch your career. We’re an award-winning employer because we encourage freedom and creativity.

What are Software Engineers at Capital One?

Our Software Engineers solve problems and define the way we work and what we do. Put simply, they create and use the tech that helps us find the right kind of credit for every customer.

What you’ll do

You’ll hone your skills within your chosen area – it could be anything from APIs to mobile and big data. We’ll give you a 10-week masterclass in software engineering and you’ll gain insights into how it enables us to support our customers.

You might build solutions in the Cloud using open source technologies. You might reimagine our whole business. You could keep up our fast-paced approach, helping with the automated testing that allows us to move at speed.

And if you’re in your penultimate year at uni, this internship could help you jump the queue onto one of our graduate programmes.

You’ll be working in either Nottingham and London, and for 10 weeks you’ll take on real projects and development training. You’ll have a buddy on your team, a programme mentor – and you’ll even get to meet the CEO.

What you’ll need
You don’t need to be on a Computer Science degree course, but you’ll need to be able to code in any language and you must be in your penultimate year of university. We don’t expect you to be an accomplished developer – just enthusiastic and a quick learner.

Capital One is committed to diversity in the workplace.

GlaxoSmithKline is one of the world's foremost pharmaceutical and healthcare companies, with statisticians and programmers working in Research and Development with a global footprint spanning the UK, US, Canada and India. The Biostatistics division includes a Clinical Programming department, covering all phases of clinical drug development and commercialisation in a wide range of therapeutic areas. Programming’s deliverables form the core of all regulatory submissions, health authority assessments, safety updates and publications (for peer review journals and scientific meetings).
In recognition of the developing sophistication and technical requirements of the role, Clinical Programming was formed as a standalone department distinct to Clinical Statistics. Programming asset teams are now stepping up to achieve the goal of being the Biostatistics’ leaders of delivery and execution, in a way that optimises, expedites and delivers to the highest quality. In addition to the group’s activities supporting GSK’s pipeline of drugs, key accountabilities include developing and implementing strategies for programming resourcing using both internal and external resource; driving CDISC implementation for the reporting of clinical trials; and identifying and implementing IT solutions to offer further benefit and efficiency for the group’s activities.
The Clinical Programming team at GSK has a strong focus on innovative ways of working and we are leading the way to implement these innovations and embracing an evolution for increased data science skills; this is already resulting in the introduction of new programming languages, technology and software. Some of these initiatives include the pathway for adoption of R and Python open source coding into day to day programming tasks, exploring machine learning to drive efficiencies for clinical reporting, developing desktop visualisation capabilities and we even have an annual challenge for Programmers who are rewarded for bringing new innovations into the department. But it’s not just about the tech! We also encourage involvement in other initiatives too and we focus on your personal development path, building your project and leadership skills, your inter-departmental liaison and collaboration skills and we provide you with opportunities to get closer to the science and decision making.
Within the clinical programming team Senior Programmers and Principal Programmers support, guide, or make a major contribution to the planning and execution of multiple programming activities for GSK clinical trials. They are accountable for creating, verifying, and documenting analyses of clinical data while adhering to study protocols, analysis plans and GSK / industry standards.

Key Responsibilities:

Act as a subject matter expert and work as a guide within own discipline to investigate new technology as directed.
Provide technical contribution to complex tasks.
Ensure the collection of programs/outputs and issues are adequately managed for programming activities to achieve business outcomes.
Apply learning from previous activities to result in quicker and more efficient completion of the current task.
Share learnings with peers and contribute to internal technical discussions/forums.
Initiate new directions and novel strategies to achieve department goals.

About the job
Summary
The UK’s nuclear deterrent is moving to a new and critical phase as we begin to develop our next generation of nuclear warheads. Building these, and maintaining throughout their service lives, needs us to ensure we can access specialist materials to meet the programme requirements. This role will help ensure that this happens, through providing strategic leadership across delivery teams in the Warhead Directorate’s infrastructure and materials delivery group.
Job description
This is a genuinely exciting time to join the Ministry of Defence if you want to be at the heart of real Defence issues. You will get to work on a high profile and distinctive portfolio which is rarely out of the news, and have a unique insight into the fascinating world of nuclear.

Established in April 2016, the Defence Nuclear Organisation (DNO) was set up to oversee all aspects of nuclear business within the MoD; responsible for all submarines (from buying them through to disposal when they reach the end of their life), nuclear warheads, skills, related infrastructure and day-to-day nuclear policy. DNO consists of the people, equipment and infrastructure required to successfully deter the most extreme threats to our national security and way of life.

Within DNO, the Warhead Directorate leads the UK nuclear warhead programme which provides a stockpile of reliable, safe and effective nuclear warheads to support the UK’s strategic nuclear deterrent now and in the future. This is delivered through the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), based near Reading.

These posts will be based in either London, Bristol or Reading, with regular travel required to other locations. The long-term nature of the nuclear programme, the large amounts of investment required, and the specialised nature of the facilities and materials involved mean that there are unique challenges that need to be considered both in the short and long term. As well as working within a busy DNO area, it will require substantial work across and outside Government.

This work will span highly-technical areas, and as such the post holder will not be expected to have pre-existing expertise in nuclear infrastructure, engineering, or materials. Although experience in any of these areas will be of benefit, the most important skills for the successful postholder will be agility: working to develop options and delivery solutions to meet the programme requirements; in moving quickly between short term and long term perspectives over the nuclear programme; and in working effectively across organisational boundaries.

Responsibilities
These new roles will be responsible for leading on material projects within the DNO Warhead materials delivery group.

Key responsibilities will include:

• Developing and maintaining a delivery plan for the materials projects under their responsibility, managing the medium and long-term challenges.
• The roles will be responsible for provision of their strategic materials to meet the warhead programme requirements.
• Identifying areas of specific longer-term challenge, and developing options to meet these challenges, including working with other government departments and industry to ensure policy and implementation take place for future requirements.
• Provision of recommendations and advice to senior management and ministers to enable decisions and approvals to be obtained to ensure programme delivery. This advice must acknowledge the broader context and be based on clear and accurate evidence.
• Managing and controlling projects in support of MOD requirements, through contract delivery and management. Delivery of their in-year material projects scope within the agreed performance/time/cost envelope including assessment of milestones. Agreement of scope changes, efficiencies, savings and trades.
• Management, development and provision of robust evidence (to satisfy external scrutiny and assurance) for DNO capital projects business cases that require MOD Approval (from the MoD Investment Approvals Committee). Working across DNO to deliver the business case to obtain required approvals.
• Representing the materials delivery group, including reporting, engagement with regulators, and the sponsorship of business cases.

Significant reorganisation of some elements in the materials portfolio is planned. The intent is for the postholders to have direct responsibility for small teams, to ensure planning, effective delivery and oversight as well as risk and opportunity management.

The successful candidate should be able to demonstrate a track record of providing excellent project management across complex organisational boundaries that results in clear, tangible outputs in challenging environments.

Excellent communication skills – written and oral – are essential to this role, as is the ability to identify and articulate shared objectives, options analysis and delivery solutions, business case development across HMG departments, industry and partner government boundaries.

Experience of working on nuclear warhead and/or infrastructure issues is desirable but not necessary.

DNO’s Warhead Directorate is split across multiple sites, and the postholder will need to travel regularly between London, Bristol and AWE, with occasional travel to other sites across the UK.

Requirements
Vision For Education is looking for a Computing Teacher with a vision. The kind of person who wants to make a difference and knows the pathway that will allow them to do so. Someone who also wants to be part of the conversation when it comes to group decisions on how the group can meet the needs of each child with regard to training, support and annual reviews.
The candidate will also need to be aware of the standards that Ofsted look out for and always conscious to exceed them, you’ll be the kind of teacher who is never anything but engaged and engaging. What’s more, you’ll be excited by the prospect of the small class sizes of 8 pupils or less, (with at least one Teaching Assistant) and will seize upon this as an opportunity to tailor learning to individuals and build stronger, more insightful teacher/pupil relationships. Empathetic and passionate, you’ll understand that the pupils’ journeys aren’t necessarily linear. If you haven’t worked in SEN before, but are enthusiastic and motivated to make the move, the school will give you all the additional training and support you require.

Full time, fixed term contract for 4 years.

Applications are invited for a postdoctoral research fellow to work on the statistical data analysis of large complex data sets in human egg development. You will join an interdisciplinary team between Warwick and Edinburgh and spearhead the data analysis programme.

The overall aim of the project is to deliver the first comprehensive analysis of human egg development and early embryonic cell divisions in humans. This project thus has direct relevance to understanding human infertility.

The project will involve using both a range of standard statistical/computational techniques and developing new analysis methods/algorithms. By integrating analysis over a heterogeneous data set comprising 3D images and 3D time series data, the key focus will be to identify what events in egg development predict erroneous outcomes. Techniques will thus include standard statistical methods such as regression, clustering/stratification, multivariate analysis and variable selection, but also require developing new applications of, and methods in, rare events analysis and heterogeneous data integration. Bayesian analysis methods, such as Bayesian inference (Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Sequential Monte Carlo, Approximate Bayesian Computing) and Bayesian experimental design may potentially be required given the data’s complexity and heterogeneity.

Desirable skills: The ideal candidate will have a PhD in a relevant subject such as statistics, mathematics, physics, operations research, computer science or data science, and have a strong statistics background. Candidates with either Bayesian or traditional statistical backgrounds are encouraged to apply. Having experience with a range of statistical techniques, experience with analysis of large complex multi-variate data sets or with developing algorithms for (statistical) analysis of complex (heterogeneous) data sets will be an advantage. Candidates should be able to programme in a high-level language for data analysis such as R, MatLab or Python, whilst programming skills in C++, Rcc or similar are an advantage. A background in biology is NOT required but a willingness and enthusiasm for communicating with biologists is strongly encouraged.

If you have not yet been awarded your PhD but are near submission or recently submitted your PhD, any offers of employment will be made as Research Assistant on level 5 of the University grade structure (£30,046). Upon successful award of your PhD and evidence of this fact, you will be promoted to Research Fellow on the first point of level 6 of the University grade structure (£30,942 pa).

Applications via the HR website should include 1) a letter of application outlining previous research experience/significant results and why you are interested in the post, 2) a CV, 3) a list of publications, and 4) links to a small selection of reprints/preprints/publications from your PhD/latest research post as appropriate. Scientific queries about the project can be made to Prof Burroughs, N.J.Burroughs@warwick.ac.uk, website https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/zeeman_institute/staffv2/burroughs/.

What's Next?
Help us learn about you by submitting a complete and thoughtful application, which includes your CV. Your application and CV is a way for us to initially get to know you, so it's important to complete all relevant application questions so we have as much information about you as possible.
After you confirm your application, we will review it to determine whether you meet certain required qualifications.

Pymetrics will allow you to showcase your potential beyond what you tell us in your CV and application form.
