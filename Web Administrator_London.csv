We have an exciting opportunity for a passionate and skilled, predominantly back-end focussed, developer to join the small team that develops and supports our brand new system, ""Pulse"", to support our pension scheme clients.
What's the role?

At LCP we advise and support pension schemes. We have been developing ""Pulse"", our new cloud-based system for managing a pension scheme. It includes:
A portal for pension scheme members to look at the pension they will receive and model their options for when they retire.
In house tools for pension administrators to manage case work, manage member data to help them support pension scheme members
A portal for our clients (the pension scheme trustees) to monitor what is happening in the scheme
Integrations with payroll, back accounts and more to automate data flows and increasingly move to member self-service.
We have a track record of getting solutions to market quickly with developers that can work nimbly and discuss designs/functional requirements with non-technical end users. We don’t, as a rule, follow specific development frameworks, but generally work in an agile way.
Pulse began development in 2019 and is now live with its first clients. It is fully cloud based (Azure) and is developing rapidly as we look to automate and extend our services. Pulse is already the best framework in the industry, and we want to pull away from the competition with what we can go on to achieve with it.
What will you be doing?
Working mostly on the server (or server-less) side in conjunction with front-end developers across different areas including security, apis, databases, connectivity, deployment, monitoring and performance
Taking ownership of a given task/functional requirement and getting it out to users with support from the wider team
What essential skills, experience and personal qualities do you you need for this position?
Experience with C# and broader .NET framework including .NET Core.
Familiarity with cloud technologies, specifically Azure including some of Azure functions, Azure SQL, Azure B2C, Service fabric and blob storage
Experience with the traditional Microsoft web stack – IIS, ASP, .NET
Continuous Integration, build/deployment pipelines
A team player, able to work closely with the wider team and develop junior team members. Open to other’s ideas and different ways of working
Positive can-do approach to any task but also willing to question requirements and approaches
The ability to solve problems and find solutions using the right services and tools
The ability to adapt and learn on the job
The ability to work in, and enhance, a high pace environment
In addition there are a few things which it would be useful to have but not necessarily essential. These are:
Git source code management / branching strategies and use of Azure DevOps
Experience with front end frameworks (We predominantly use Vue but similar framework experience also useful)
An understanding of application security and experience working with security standards such as oAuth, ideally using Azure B2C
Comfortable working with relational and non-relational databases
Why LCP?
Our biggest strength is our people. We are home to talented, well-recognised industry experts, and we are committed to ensuring a bright and interesting future for all.

Pulse began development in 2019 and is now live with its first clients. It is fully cloud based (Azure) and is developing rapidly as we look to automate and extend our services.

The ability to solve problems and find solutions using the right services and tools

An understanding of application security and experience working with security standards such as oAuth, ideally using Azure B2C

The Role

We are looking for a Senior Fullstack JavaScript Engineer to join an experienced engineering team, to build out new web services, and UI projects, and to help maintain and support existing projects.

We are looking for candidates who are as comfortable writing high-performance REST APIs, and handling complex data entities and rules, as

The term “fullstack” for them means a self-sufficient JavaScript web developer with solid, proven commercial experience in all aspects of web application delivery:
Writing performant and secure backend API services
Understanding and managing server load and service health
Building UI pages according to a design spec, and with a good understanding of common UX principles
Being able to setup and work with various development environments and OS/browser configurations for UI testing and development
Writing client-side application code to interact with backend services, and interact with browser DOM and UI elements
Building custom UI components, as well as making best use of framework components
Writing unit and integration tests for both backend and front-end code
Working collaboratively within a GitHub branch workflow, merging code and resolving conflicts
Writing both internal and client-facing documentation

The term “senior” to us, means:
Having solid, proven, commercial experience in all aspects of web application delivery
Being able to understand and discuss technical and business requirements
Taking ownership of their work – not leaving responsibility to “someone else”
Being able to effectively communicate with stakeholders, developers, system administrators, and clients alike
Having a “do whatever it takes” attitude towards problem-solving and also to project delivery

Understanding the importance of web security, and how to implement it in all levels of a web application
Having enough knowledge of data stores to be able to optimise slow-running queries, and apply proper indexing strategies

You will report directly to the Project Lead, who will review your work, indirectly to the CTO who will govern technical strategy, and your delivery and priorities will be managed by the project manager. You will work with our existing JavaScript team, to ensure your work follows a consistent and standard approach. You will also work alongside system administrators, DBAs, Java and PHP developers at some point during your work.

Essentials
You should be a hard-working, meticulous individual who pays attention to detail. You should have solid technical ability, demonstrated commercially. You should be a clear communicator, a good listener, able to discuss technical concerns professionally with clients, and non-technical team members. You will be expected to follow specifications and instructions closely, and document your work where required.
You should be able to work carefully under pressure, adhere to timelines, and as a senior technician you will be expected to take full ownership of your work.
Your 5+ years of commercial JavaScript web development should have made you familiar with the challenges faced when building highly available, performant and scalable web applications. You should also be security-focused, meticulous in nature and have the seniority to ask the right questions, organise your work effectively, fill in any gaps and prioritise properly.
Your coding standard should be as impeccable as your ability to work to standards given to you – and your coding style demonstrating your seniority in JavaScript development.
You will have worked commercially at least once with a distributed microservice architecture, giving you hands-on experience in; horizontal scaling, database connection management, impact under burst loads, and an understanding of the importance of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
Above all – you should be commercially-minded and delivery-focused. While being a technical purist is admirable, this should be balanced out with a “can-do, will-do” attitude.

About the job
Summary
The Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) is a new organisation that is being set up as part of the UK’s arrangements for leaving the EU. We will be an independent public body helping protect and sustain UK industry and jobs from unfair international trade practices, investigating import practices such as dumping (selling goods overseas at prices lower than in the domestic market), and industrial subsidies. These practices, along with unexpected surges in imports, can damage UK industries.

Trade remedies can counter this by applying an additional duty at the border. This is an important part of the international trade policy framework and trade remedies are vital to many UK industries. This area was previously handled for the UK by the European Commission, so this is an exciting time to join us as we begin our operations, undertaking work which has not been carried out in the UK for many decades. We are already carrying out transition reviews into existing EU measures to assess whether they are suitable for the UK and from January 2021, we will open to applications from UK industries for new investigations.

Until the Trade Bill is passed – expected to happen in the next few months – we are the Trade Remedies Investigations Directorate (TRID), a directorate of the Department for International Trade (DIT). DIT is the civil service department responsible for bringing together policy, promotion and financial expertise to deliver a new trade policy framework now that the UK has left the EU. When the Trade Bill is passed, we will be legally established as a Non-Departmental Public Body (NDPB) outside the civil service.

Depending on when you join us, you will either initially be engaged by DIT as a civil servant and subsequently transfer to the TRA with our current staff and become a public servant or you will join us directly as a public servant. At the point of transfer, all current DIT Ts&Cs will transfer to the TRA, subject to consultation with the Trade Unions.

We are based in central Reading and number around 100 people, with our own analysts, corporate support staff and legal specialists, as well as investigators.
Job description

About the job
Summary
HMRC Strategies have used external research and models of best practice for tax administration to identify key statements that define a healthy tax system:

• revenue is collected to fund essential public services, as measured by tax receipts and the tax gap;
• it is easy to pay the right tax, as assessed by customer satisfaction levels, customer costs, and HMRC costs; and
• the way tax is administered is demonstrably fair and perceived as such.

As the Deputy Director of Tax Administration Strategies, you will design, drive, articulate and assure the implementation of HMRC’s core strategic content across HMRC and specifically across Customer Strategies for our individual, wealthy, small, mid-size and large business customer base.
Delivery requires leading a team that works, at pace, with stakeholders and external delivery partners in a connected, collaborative and innovative way to meet HMRC strategic objectives. Together with a natural curiosity, attention to intellectual rigour and use of evidence, the role demands the ability to communicate in diverse contexts across internal and external stakeholders. Working closely with, and engaging across, the HMRC Executive Committee and the Non-Executive Board is a routine part of the role.

You will be responsible for leading and developing a team of around 20 people and you will have a strong personal accountability for effectively conveying and influencing the way the organisation extracts the value and benefits of business customer strategies to internal and external delivery partners.

You will be part of an integrated Senior Leadership team of 4 Deputy Directors in the HMRC Strategies Directorate. All 4 Deputy Directors are expected to complement and support the work of the others and to be ambassadors for HMRC strategic content. To do so you will require a systemic understanding of the tax system and its place in society.
Job description
• Lead, build and develop a high performing team and contribute to a high performing HMRC Strategies Senior Leadership Team·
• Take the core Business Strategy to the next phase of development. This will include ensuring coherence with wider Whitehall objectives (including economic growth) as well as systematically identifying and resolving risks in strategy implementation ·
• Work across the Department to assess HMRC’s progress against its priorities for Customer Strategies and advice on business prioritisation and corrective action
• Collaborate with delivery partners, to support strategy design and implementation solutions that actively contribute to HMRC’s co-creation, customer experience and cost reduction objectives
• Build and maintain strong and productive relationships with external stakeholders representing different sectors within the business community ·
• Build a strong network to influence and support policy teams and other colleagues so that the organisation can use strategic content. Relatedly act as guardian of the core tax administration strategy and associated customer strategies – i.e. ensure that they are used properly
• Play an active role in promoting the Directorate's identity and ways of working through corporate leadership and influencing across other parts of HMRC

Key Interactions:
The Directorate is relatively small and team work matters. Wanting to be part of a team and using knowledge and information to support the way the Directorate performs is important. In this role you will:

• role model and embody SCS leadership values (Inspiring, Confident and Empowering) for your team, the wider directorate and HMRC;
• focus outwards in your role, collaborate across the Department and with customers to deliver joint outcomes, strengthen the professionalism and reputation of the Civil Service; and
• work with SCS colleagues and their teams in HMRC Strategies to build new, more flexible ways of working in the Directorate

The Directorate's identity and ways of working have never mattered more; we are small and need to influence beyond our weight across HMRC and with our external stakeholders. Therefore, wanting to be part of a team and using knowledge and information to support the way the Directorate performs is a performance imperative.

Responsibilities
The successful candidate will require:

• Excellent leadership skills with the ability to nurture and build capability within and across teams
• A strong track record of building effective internal and external partnerships very quickly across organisational boundaries
• Proven experience of shaping or implementing insight driven strategic solutions, preferably across a large and complex organisation
• Excellent communication and influencing skills to engage confidently in a wide range of situations
• An ability to ‘think outside of the box’ to deliver strategic shifts in thinking that can be translated into practical choices for future strategy development and implementation
• Knowledge and demonstrable experience of building relationships with businesses and an understanding of key drivers that impact how businesses operate
• Knowledge of tax, the different types of tax and their relative strengths and weaknesses (no mandatory tax training is required for the role)
• An ability to provide structure and direction when there may be little existing precedent or practice, and to support teams through ambiguity
• Strong analytical skills with the ability to shape a coherent research programme that will deliver robust conclusions that can be used to set key long-term aspirations for HMRC

Desirable

• Experience of developing and implementing performance metrics
Benefits
• Learning and development tailored to your role

• Flexible working patterns including part-time or time-term working and access to Flexible Working Schemes allowing you to vary your working day providing you work your total hours

About the job
Summary
HMRC Strategies have used external research and models of best practice for tax administration to identify key statements that define a healthy tax system:

• revenue is collected to fund essential public services, as measured by tax receipts and the tax gap;
• it is easy to pay the right tax, as assessed by customer satisfaction levels, customer costs, and HMRC costs; and
• the way tax is administered is demonstrably fair and perceived as such.

As the Deputy Director of Tax Administration Strategies, you will design, drive, articulate and assure the implementation of HMRC’s core strategic content across HMRC and specifically across Customer Strategies for our individual, wealthy, small, mid-size and large business customer base.
Delivery requires leading a team that works, at pace, with stakeholders and external delivery partners in a connected, collaborative and innovative way to meet HMRC strategic objectives. Together with a natural curiosity, attention to intellectual rigour and use of evidence, the role demands the ability to communicate in diverse contexts across internal and external stakeholders. Working closely with, and engaging across, the HMRC Executive Committee and the Non-Executive Board is a routine part of the role.

You will be responsible for leading and developing a team of around 20 people and you will have a strong personal accountability for effectively conveying and influencing the way the organisation extracts the value and benefits of business customer strategies to internal and external delivery partners.

You will be part of an integrated Senior Leadership team of 4 Deputy Directors in the HMRC Strategies Directorate. All 4 Deputy Directors are expected to complement and support the work of the others and to be ambassadors for HMRC strategic content. To do so you will require a systemic understanding of the tax system and its place in society.
Job description
• Lead, build and develop a high performing team and contribute to a high performing HMRC Strategies Senior Leadership Team·
• Take the core Business Strategy to the next phase of development. This will include ensuring coherence with wider Whitehall objectives (including economic growth) as well as systematically identifying and resolving risks in strategy implementation ·

• Collaborate with delivery partners, to support strategy design and implementation solutions that actively contribute to HMRC’s co-creation, customer experience and cost reduction objectives

• Play an active role in promoting the Directorate's identity and ways of working through corporate leadership and influencing across other parts of HMRC

Key Interactions:
The Directorate is relatively small and team work matters. Wanting to be part of a team and using knowledge and information to support the way the Directorate performs is important. In this role you will:

• role model and embody SCS leadership values (Inspiring, Confident and Empowering) for your team, the wider directorate and HMRC;
• focus outwards in your role, collaborate across the Department and with customers to deliver joint outcomes, strengthen the professionalism and reputation of the Civil Service; and
• work with SCS colleagues and their teams in HMRC Strategies to build new, more flexible ways of working in the Directorate

The Directorate's identity and ways of working have never mattered more; we are small and need to influence beyond our weight across HMRC and with our external stakeholders. Therefore, wanting to be part of a team and using knowledge and information to support the way the Directorate performs is a performance imperative.

Responsibilities
The successful candidate will require:

• Excellent leadership skills with the ability to nurture and build capability within and across teams

• Knowledge and demonstrable experience of building relationships with businesses and an understanding of key drivers that impact how businesses operate
• Knowledge of tax, the different types of tax and their relative strengths and weaknesses (no mandatory tax training is required for the role)
• An ability to provide structure and direction when there may be little existing precedent or practice, and to support teams through ambiguity
• Strong analytical skills with the ability to shape a coherent research programme that will deliver robust conclusions that can be used to set key long-term aspirations for HMRC

• Experience of developing and implementing performance metrics
Benefits

About the job
Summary
HMRC Strategies have used external research and models of best practice for tax administration to identify key statements that define a healthy tax system:

• revenue is collected to fund essential public services, as measured by tax receipts and the tax gap;
• it is easy to pay the right tax, as assessed by customer satisfaction levels, customer costs, and HMRC costs; and
• the way tax is administered is demonstrably fair and perceived as such.

As the Deputy Director of Tax Administration Strategies, you will design, drive, articulate and assure the implementation of HMRC’s core strategic content across HMRC and specifically across Customer Strategies for our individual, wealthy, small, mid-size and large business customer base.
Delivery requires leading a team that works, at pace, with stakeholders and external delivery partners in a connected, collaborative and innovative way to meet HMRC strategic objectives. Together with a natural curiosity, attention to intellectual rigour and use of evidence, the role demands the ability to communicate in diverse contexts across internal and external stakeholders. Working closely with, and engaging across, the HMRC Executive Committee and the Non-Executive Board is a routine part of the role.

You will be responsible for leading and developing a team of around 20 people and you will have a strong personal accountability for effectively conveying and influencing the way the organisation extracts the value and benefits of business customer strategies to internal and external delivery partners.

You will be part of an integrated Senior Leadership team of 4 Deputy Directors in the HMRC Strategies Directorate. All 4 Deputy Directors are expected to complement and support the work of the others and to be ambassadors for HMRC strategic content. To do so you will require a systemic understanding of the tax system and its place in society.
Job description
• Lead, build and develop a high performing team and contribute to a high performing HMRC Strategies Senior Leadership Team·
• Take the core Business Strategy to the next phase of development. This will include ensuring coherence with wider Whitehall objectives (including economic growth) as well as systematically identifying and resolving risks in strategy implementation ·

• Play an active role in promoting the Directorate's identity and ways of working through corporate leadership and influencing across other parts of HMRC

Key Interactions:
The Directorate is relatively small and team work matters. Wanting to be part of a team and using knowledge and information to support the way the Directorate performs is important. In this role you will:

• role model and embody SCS leadership values (Inspiring, Confident and Empowering) for your team, the wider directorate and HMRC;
• focus outwards in your role, collaborate across the Department and with customers to deliver joint outcomes, strengthen the professionalism and reputation of the Civil Service; and
• work with SCS colleagues and their teams in HMRC Strategies to build new, more flexible ways of working in the Directorate

The Directorate's identity and ways of working have never mattered more; we are small and need to influence beyond our weight across HMRC and with our external stakeholders. Therefore, wanting to be part of a team and using knowledge and information to support the way the Directorate performs is a performance imperative.

Responsibilities
The successful candidate will require:

• Excellent leadership skills with the ability to nurture and build capability within and across teams

• Knowledge and demonstrable experience of building relationships with businesses and an understanding of key drivers that impact how businesses operate
• Knowledge of tax, the different types of tax and their relative strengths and weaknesses (no mandatory tax training is required for the role)
• An ability to provide structure and direction when there may be little existing precedent or practice, and to support teams through ambiguity
• Strong analytical skills with the ability to shape a coherent research programme that will deliver robust conclusions that can be used to set key long-term aspirations for HMRC

About the job
Summary
HMRC Strategies have used external research and models of best practice for tax administration to identify key statements that define a healthy tax system:

• revenue is collected to fund essential public services, as measured by tax receipts and the tax gap;
• it is easy to pay the right tax, as assessed by customer satisfaction levels, customer costs, and HMRC costs; and
• the way tax is administered is demonstrably fair and perceived as such.

As the Deputy Director of Tax Administration Strategies, you will design, drive, articulate and assure the implementation of HMRC’s core strategic content across HMRC and specifically across Customer Strategies for our individual, wealthy, small, mid-size and large business customer base.
Delivery requires leading a team that works, at pace, with stakeholders and external delivery partners in a connected, collaborative and innovative way to meet HMRC strategic objectives. Together with a natural curiosity, attention to intellectual rigour and use of evidence, the role demands the ability to communicate in diverse contexts across internal and external stakeholders. Working closely with, and engaging across, the HMRC Executive Committee and the Non-Executive Board is a routine part of the role.

You will be responsible for leading and developing a team of around 20 people and you will have a strong personal accountability for effectively conveying and influencing the way the organisation extracts the value and benefits of business customer strategies to internal and external delivery partners.

You will be part of an integrated Senior Leadership team of 4 Deputy Directors in the HMRC Strategies Directorate. All 4 Deputy Directors are expected to complement and support the work of the others and to be ambassadors for HMRC strategic content. To do so you will require a systemic understanding of the tax system and its place in society.
Job description
• Lead, build and develop a high performing team and contribute to a high performing HMRC Strategies Senior Leadership Team·
• Take the core Business Strategy to the next phase of development. This will include ensuring coherence with wider Whitehall objectives (including economic growth) as well as systematically identifying and resolving risks in strategy implementation ·

• Play an active role in promoting the Directorate's identity and ways of working through corporate leadership and influencing across other parts of HMRC

Key Interactions:
The Directorate is relatively small and team work matters. Wanting to be part of a team and using knowledge and information to support the way the Directorate performs is important. In this role you will:

• role model and embody SCS leadership values (Inspiring, Confident and Empowering) for your team, the wider directorate and HMRC;
• focus outwards in your role, collaborate across the Department and with customers to deliver joint outcomes, strengthen the professionalism and reputation of the Civil Service; and
• work with SCS colleagues and their teams in HMRC Strategies to build new, more flexible ways of working in the Directorate

The Directorate's identity and ways of working have never mattered more; we are small and need to influence beyond our weight across HMRC and with our external stakeholders. Therefore, wanting to be part of a team and using knowledge and information to support the way the Directorate performs is a performance imperative.

Responsibilities
The successful candidate will require:

• Excellent leadership skills with the ability to nurture and build capability within and across teams

• Knowledge and demonstrable experience of building relationships with businesses and an understanding of key drivers that impact how businesses operate
• Knowledge of tax, the different types of tax and their relative strengths and weaknesses (no mandatory tax training is required for the role)
• An ability to provide structure and direction when there may be little existing precedent or practice, and to support teams through ambiguity
• Strong analytical skills with the ability to shape a coherent research programme that will deliver robust conclusions that can be used to set key long-term aspirations for HMRC

• Experience of developing and implementing performance metrics
Benefits

About the job
Summary
HMRC Strategies have used external research and models of best practice for tax administration to identify key statements that define a healthy tax system:

• revenue is collected to fund essential public services, as measured by tax receipts and the tax gap;
• it is easy to pay the right tax, as assessed by customer satisfaction levels, customer costs, and HMRC costs; and
• the way tax is administered is demonstrably fair and perceived as such.

As the Deputy Director of Tax Administration Strategies, you will design, drive, articulate and assure the implementation of HMRC’s core strategic content across HMRC and specifically across Customer Strategies for our individual, wealthy, small, mid-size and large business customer base.
Delivery requires leading a team that works, at pace, with stakeholders and external delivery partners in a connected, collaborative and innovative way to meet HMRC strategic objectives. Together with a natural curiosity, attention to intellectual rigour and use of evidence, the role demands the ability to communicate in diverse contexts across internal and external stakeholders. Working closely with, and engaging across, the HMRC Executive Committee and the Non-Executive Board is a routine part of the role.

You will be responsible for leading and developing a team of around 20 people and you will have a strong personal accountability for effectively conveying and influencing the way the organisation extracts the value and benefits of business customer strategies to internal and external delivery partners.

You will be part of an integrated Senior Leadership team of 4 Deputy Directors in the HMRC Strategies Directorate. All 4 Deputy Directors are expected to complement and support the work of the others and to be ambassadors for HMRC strategic content. To do so you will require a systemic understanding of the tax system and its place in society.
Job description
• Lead, build and develop a high performing team and contribute to a high performing HMRC Strategies Senior Leadership Team·
• Take the core Business Strategy to the next phase of development. This will include ensuring coherence with wider Whitehall objectives (including economic growth) as well as systematically identifying and resolving risks in strategy implementation ·
• Work across the Department to assess HMRC’s progress against its priorities for Customer Strategies and advice on business prioritisation and corrective action
• Collaborate with delivery partners, to support strategy design and implementation solutions that actively contribute to HMRC’s co-creation, customer experience and cost reduction objectives
• Build and maintain strong and productive relationships with external stakeholders representing different sectors within the business community ·
• Build a strong network to influence and support policy teams and other colleagues so that the organisation can use strategic content. Relatedly act as guardian of the core tax administration strategy and associated customer strategies – i.e. ensure that they are used properly
• Play an active role in promoting the Directorate's identity and ways of working through corporate leadership and influencing across other parts of HMRC

Key Interactions:
The Directorate is relatively small and team work matters. Wanting to be part of a team and using knowledge and information to support the way the Directorate performs is important. In this role you will:

• role model and embody SCS leadership values (Inspiring, Confident and Empowering) for your team, the wider directorate and HMRC;
• focus outwards in your role, collaborate across the Department and with customers to deliver joint outcomes, strengthen the professionalism and reputation of the Civil Service; and
• work with SCS colleagues and their teams in HMRC Strategies to build new, more flexible ways of working in the Directorate

The Directorate's identity and ways of working have never mattered more; we are small and need to influence beyond our weight across HMRC and with our external stakeholders. Therefore, wanting to be part of a team and using knowledge and information to support the way the Directorate performs is a performance imperative.

Responsibilities
The successful candidate will require:

• Excellent leadership skills with the ability to nurture and build capability within and across teams
• A strong track record of building effective internal and external partnerships very quickly across organisational boundaries
• Proven experience of shaping or implementing insight driven strategic solutions, preferably across a large and complex organisation

• the way tax is administered is demonstrably fair and perceived as such.

As the Deputy Director of Tax Administration Strategies, you will design, drive, articulate and assure the implementation of HMRC’s core strategic content across HMRC and specifically across Customer Strategies for our individual, wealthy, small, mid-size and large business customer base.
Delivery requires leading a team that works, at pace, with stakeholders and external delivery partners in a connected, collaborative and innovative way to meet HMRC strategic objectives. Together with a natural curiosity, attention to intellectual rigour and use of evidence, the role demands the ability to communicate in diverse contexts across internal and external stakeholders. Working closely with, and engaging across, the HMRC Executive Committee and the Non-Executive Board is a routine part of the role.

You will be responsible for leading and developing a team of around 20 people and you will have a strong personal accountability for effectively conveying and influencing the way the organisation extracts the value and benefits of business customer strategies to internal and external delivery partners.

You will be part of an integrated Senior Leadership team of 4 Deputy Directors in the HMRC Strategies Directorate. All 4 Deputy Directors are expected to complement and support the work of the others and to be ambassadors for HMRC strategic content. To do so you will require a systemic understanding of the tax system and its place in society.
Job description
• Lead, build and develop a high performing team and contribute to a high performing HMRC Strategies Senior Leadership Team·
• Take the core Business Strategy to the next phase of development. This will include ensuring coherence with wider Whitehall objectives (including economic growth) as well as systematically identifying and resolving risks in strategy implementation ·
• Work across the Department to assess HMRC’s progress against its priorities for Customer Strategies and advice on business prioritisation and corrective action
• Collaborate with delivery partners, to support strategy design and implementation solutions that actively contribute to HMRC’s co-creation, customer experience and cost reduction objectives
• Build and maintain strong and productive relationships with external stakeholders representing different sectors within the business community ·
• Build a strong network to influence and support policy teams and other colleagues so that the organisation can use strategic content. Relatedly act as guardian of the core tax administration strategy and associated customer strategies – i.e. ensure that they are used properly
• Play an active role in promoting the Directorate's identity and ways of working through corporate leadership and influencing across other parts of HMRC

Key Interactions:
The Directorate is relatively small and team work matters. Wanting to be part of a team and using knowledge and information to support the way the Directorate performs is important. In this role you will:

• role model and embody SCS leadership values (Inspiring, Confident and Empowering) for your team, the wider directorate and HMRC;
• focus outwards in your role, collaborate across the Department and with customers to deliver joint outcomes, strengthen the professionalism and reputation of the Civil Service; and
• work with SCS colleagues and their teams in HMRC Strategies to build new, more flexible ways of working in the Directorate

The Directorate's identity and ways of working have never mattered more; we are small and need to influence beyond our weight across HMRC and with our external stakeholders. Therefore, wanting to be part of a team and using knowledge and information to support the way the Directorate performs is a performance imperative.

Responsibilities
The successful candidate will require:

• Excellent leadership skills with the ability to nurture and build capability within and across teams
• A strong track record of building effective internal and external partnerships very quickly across organisational boundaries
• Proven experience of shaping or implementing insight driven strategic solutions, preferably across a large and complex organisation
• Excellent communication and influencing skills to engage confidently in a wide range of situations
• An ability to ‘think outside of the box’ to deliver strategic shifts in thinking that can be translated into practical choices for future strategy development and implementation
• Knowledge and demonstrable experience of building relationships with businesses and an understanding of key drivers that impact how businesses operate
• Knowledge of tax, the different types of tax and their relative strengths and weaknesses (no mandatory tax training is required for the role)
• An ability to provide structure and direction when there may be little existing precedent or practice, and to support teams through ambiguity
• Strong analytical skills with the ability to shape a coherent research programme that will deliver robust conclusions that can be used to set key long-term aspirations for HMRC

Desirable

• Experience of developing and implementing performance metrics
Benefits
• Learning and development tailored to your role

• Flexible working patterns including part-time or time-term working and access to Flexible Working Schemes allowing you to vary your working day providing you work your total hours
• Generous paid maternity and paternity leave which is notably more than the statutory minimum offered by many other employers
• Childcare benefits (policy for new employees as of 5 April 2018): The government has introduced the Tax-Free Childcare (TFC) scheme.
Working parents can open an online childcare account and for every £8 they pay in, the government adds £2, up to a maximum of £2000 a year for each child or £4000 for a disabled child.

About the job
Summary
HMRC Strategies have used external research and models of best practice for tax administration to identify key statements that define a healthy tax system:

• revenue is collected to fund essential public services, as measured by tax receipts and the tax gap;
• it is easy to pay the right tax, as assessed by customer satisfaction levels, customer costs, and HMRC costs; and
• the way tax is administered is demonstrably fair and perceived as such.

As the Deputy Director of Tax Administration Strategies, you will design, drive, articulate and assure the implementation of HMRC’s core strategic content across HMRC and specifically across Customer Strategies for our individual, wealthy, small, mid-size and large business customer base.
Delivery requires leading a team that works, at pace, with stakeholders and external delivery partners in a connected, collaborative and innovative way to meet HMRC strategic objectives. Together with a natural curiosity, attention to intellectual rigour and use of evidence, the role demands the ability to communicate in diverse contexts across internal and external stakeholders. Working closely with, and engaging across, the HMRC Executive Committee and the Non-Executive Board is a routine part of the role.

You will be responsible for leading and developing a team of around 20 people and you will have a strong personal accountability for effectively conveying and influencing the way the organisation extracts the value and benefits of business customer strategies to internal and external delivery partners.

You will be part of an integrated Senior Leadership team of 4 Deputy Directors in the HMRC Strategies Directorate. All 4 Deputy Directors are expected to complement and support the work of the others and to be ambassadors for HMRC strategic content. To do so you will require a systemic understanding of the tax system and its place in society.
Job description
• Lead, build and develop a high performing team and contribute to a high performing HMRC Strategies Senior Leadership Team·
• Take the core Business Strategy to the next phase of development. This will include ensuring coherence with wider Whitehall objectives (including economic growth) as well as systematically identifying and resolving risks in strategy implementation ·
• Work across the Department to assess HMRC’s progress against its priorities for Customer Strategies and advice on business prioritisation and corrective action
• Collaborate with delivery partners, to support strategy design and implementation solutions that actively contribute to HMRC’s co-creation, customer experience and cost reduction objectives
• Build and maintain strong and productive relationships with external stakeholders representing different sectors within the business community ·
• Build a strong network to influence and support policy teams and other colleagues so that the organisation can use strategic content. Relatedly act as guardian of the core tax administration strategy and associated customer strategies – i.e. ensure that they are used properly
• Play an active role in promoting the Directorate's identity and ways of working through corporate leadership and influencing across other parts of HMRC

Key Interactions:
The Directorate is relatively small and team work matters. Wanting to be part of a team and using knowledge and information to support the way the Directorate performs is important. In this role you will:

• role model and embody SCS leadership values (Inspiring, Confident and Empowering) for your team, the wider directorate and HMRC;
• focus outwards in your role, collaborate across the Department and with customers to deliver joint outcomes, strengthen the professionalism and reputation of the Civil Service; and
• work with SCS colleagues and their teams in HMRC Strategies to build new, more flexible ways of working in the Directorate

The Directorate's identity and ways of working have never mattered more; we are small and need to influence beyond our weight across HMRC and with our external stakeholders. Therefore, wanting to be part of a team and using knowledge and information to support the way the Directorate performs is a performance imperative.

Responsibilities
The successful candidate will require:

• Excellent leadership skills with the ability to nurture and build capability within and across teams
• A strong track record of building effective internal and external partnerships very quickly across organisational boundaries
• Proven experience of shaping or implementing insight driven strategic solutions, preferably across a large and complex organisation
• Excellent communication and influencing skills to engage confidently in a wide range of situations
• An ability to ‘think outside of the box’ to deliver strategic shifts in thinking that can be translated into practical choices for future strategy development and implementation
• Knowledge and demonstrable experience of building relationships with businesses and an understanding of key drivers that impact how businesses operate
• Knowledge of tax, the different types of tax and their relative strengths and weaknesses (no mandatory tax training is required for the role)
• An ability to provide structure and direction when there may be little existing precedent or practice, and to support teams through ambiguity
• Strong analytical skills with the ability to shape a coherent research programme that will deliver robust conclusions that can be used to set key long-term aspirations for HMRC

Desirable

• Experience of developing and implementing performance metrics
Benefits
• Learning and development tailored to your role
• An environment with flexible working options
• A culture encouraging inclusion and diversity
• A Civil Service pension

• Competitive contributory pension scheme that you can enter as soon as you join where we will make a significant contribution to the cost of your pension; where your contributions come out of your salary before any tax is taken; and where your pension will continue to provide valuable benefits for you and your family if you are too ill to continue to work or die before you retire
• Flexible working patterns including part-time or time-term working and access to Flexible Working Schemes allowing you to vary your working day providing you work your total hours
• Generous paid maternity and paternity leave which is notably more than the statutory minimum offered by many other employers
• Childcare benefits (policy for new employees as of 5 April 2018): The government has introduced the Tax-Free Childcare (TFC) scheme.
Working parents can open an online childcare account and for every £8 they pay in, the government adds £2, up to a maximum of £2000 a year for each child or £4000 for a disabled child. Parents then use the funds to pay for registered childcare. Existing employees may be able to continue to claim childcare vouchers, so please check how the policy would work for you here

• Opportunity to use onsite facilities including fitness centres and staff canteens (where applicable)

About the job
Summary
HMRC Strategies have used external research and models of best practice for tax administration to identify key statements that define a healthy tax system:

• revenue is collected to fund essential public services, as measured by tax receipts and the tax gap;
• it is easy to pay the right tax, as assessed by customer satisfaction levels, customer costs, and HMRC costs; and
• the way tax is administered is demonstrably fair and perceived as such.

As the Deputy Director of Tax Administration Strategies, you will design, drive, articulate and assure the implementation of HMRC’s core strategic content across HMRC and specifically across Customer Strategies for our individual, wealthy, small, mid-size and large business customer base.
Delivery requires leading a team that works, at pace, with stakeholders and external delivery partners in a connected, collaborative and innovative way to meet HMRC strategic objectives. Together with a natural curiosity, attention to intellectual rigour and use of evidence, the role demands the ability to communicate in diverse contexts across internal and external stakeholders. Working closely with, and engaging across, the HMRC Executive Committee and the Non-Executive Board is a routine part of the role.

You will be responsible for leading and developing a team of around 20 people and you will have a strong personal accountability for effectively conveying and influencing the way the organisation extracts the value and benefits of business customer strategies to internal and external delivery partners.

You will be part of an integrated Senior Leadership team of 4 Deputy Directors in the HMRC Strategies Directorate. All 4 Deputy Directors are expected to complement and support the work of the others and to be ambassadors for HMRC strategic content. To do so you will require a systemic understanding of the tax system and its place in society.
Job description
• Lead, build and develop a high performing team and contribute to a high performing HMRC Strategies Senior Leadership Team·
• Take the core Business Strategy to the next phase of development. This will include ensuring coherence with wider Whitehall objectives (including economic growth) as well as systematically identifying and resolving risks in strategy implementation ·
• Work across the Department to assess HMRC’s progress against its priorities for Customer Strategies and advice on business prioritisation and corrective action
• Collaborate with delivery partners, to support strategy design and implementation solutions that actively contribute to HMRC’s co-creation, customer experience and cost reduction objectives
• Build and maintain strong and productive relationships with external stakeholders representing different sectors within the business community ·
• Build a strong network to influence and support policy teams and other colleagues so that the organisation can use strategic content. Relatedly act as guardian of the core tax administration strategy and associated customer strategies – i.e. ensure that they are used properly
• Play an active role in promoting the Directorate's identity and ways of working through corporate leadership and influencing across other parts of HMRC

Key Interactions:
The Directorate is relatively small and team work matters. Wanting to be part of a team and using knowledge and information to support the way the Directorate performs is important. In this role you will:

• role model and embody SCS leadership values (Inspiring, Confident and Empowering) for your team, the wider directorate and HMRC;
• focus outwards in your role, collaborate across the Department and with customers to deliver joint outcomes, strengthen the professionalism and reputation of the Civil Service; and
• work with SCS colleagues and their teams in HMRC Strategies to build new, more flexible ways of working in the Directorate

The Directorate's identity and ways of working have never mattered more; we are small and need to influence beyond our weight across HMRC and with our external stakeholders. Therefore, wanting to be part of a team and using knowledge and information to support the way the Directorate performs is a performance imperative.

Responsibilities
The successful candidate will require:

• Excellent leadership skills with the ability to nurture and build capability within and across teams
• A strong track record of building effective internal and external partnerships very quickly across organisational boundaries
• Proven experience of shaping or implementing insight driven strategic solutions, preferably across a large and complex organisation
• Excellent communication and influencing skills to engage confidently in a wide range of situations
• An ability to ‘think outside of the box’ to deliver strategic shifts in thinking that can be translated into practical choices for future strategy development and implementation
• Knowledge and demonstrable experience of building relationships with businesses and an understanding of key drivers that impact how businesses operate
• Knowledge of tax, the different types of tax and their relative strengths and weaknesses (no mandatory tax training is required for the role)
• An ability to provide structure and direction when there may be little existing precedent or practice, and to support teams through ambiguity
• Strong analytical skills with the ability to shape a coherent research programme that will deliver robust conclusions that can be used to set key long-term aspirations for HMRC

Desirable

• Experience of developing and implementing performance metrics
Benefits
• Learning and development tailored to your role
• An environment with flexible working options
• A culture encouraging inclusion and diversity
• A Civil Service pension

• This will be complimented by one further day paid privilege entitlement to mark the Queen’s Birthday
• Competitive contributory pension scheme that you can enter as soon as you join where we will make a significant contribution to the cost of your pension; where your contributions come out of your salary before any tax is taken; and where your pension will continue to provide valuable benefits for you and your family if you are too ill to continue to work or die before you retire
• Flexible working patterns including part-time or time-term working and access to Flexible Working Schemes allowing you to vary your working day providing you work your total hours
• Generous paid maternity and paternity leave which is notably more than the statutory minimum offered by many other employers
• Childcare benefits (policy for new employees as of 5 April 2018): The government has introduced the Tax-Free Childcare (TFC) scheme.
Working parents can open an online childcare account and for every £8 they pay in, the government adds £2, up to a maximum of £2000 a year for each child or £4000 for a disabled child. Parents then use the funds to pay for registered childcare. Existing employees may be able to continue to claim childcare vouchers, so please check how the policy would work for you here
• Interest-free loans allowing you to spread the cost of an annual travel season ticket or a new bicycle.
• Opportunity to use onsite facilities including fitness centres and staff canteens (where applicable)
• Occupational sick pay
