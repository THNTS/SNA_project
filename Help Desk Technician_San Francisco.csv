By the power of an amazing product and tons of Red Bull we now have over 225,000 users spread out across 5000 offices nationwide.

But, despite being happy with what we’ve achieved we know that as industry leaders in our space there’s a lot of work left to be done. Because of that, in October 2017 we announced that SkySlope will become a part of the Fidelity National Financial (NYSE: FNF) family.
