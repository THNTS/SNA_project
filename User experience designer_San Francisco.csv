We were founded in January 2016 by former executives and engineering leaders from Google and Uber. We are funded by some of the world's best investors and entrepreneurs including Founder's Fund, Khosla Ventures, First Round Capital, Eric Schmidt (Google/Alphabet Chairman), Marc Benioff (Salesforce Founder), Joe Lonsdale (Palantir Founder), Joshua Kushner (Oscar co-Founder) and Garrett Camp (Uber co-Founder).

You can read our story here and some recent press: New Yorker, TIME, USA Today, Forbes & TechCrunch.
WHAT YOU'LL DO:
Work with experienced designers from places like Uber, frog, and IDEO
Use technology and great design to create novel, immersive experiences in our care clinics, on mobile, and on the web
Own entire projects that help make healthcare efficient, personalized, and delightful, while working alongside cross-functional teams of physicians, engineers, and operators
Your work will directly contribute to saving and improving people’s lives - for real :)
WHAT YOU’RE GOOD AT:
Design thinking - You’ve probably been a product designer, or you’ve worked extensively in UI, UX, and IX and are excited to put those chops to work on building the best healthcare experience available.
Product passion - From wireframes and mood boards to mobile feedback visuals and pixels in clinic exam rooms, you care about installing what you design into our users’ healthcare experiences.
Impact - You’re deeply mission-driven and you think there’s more to life than designing games or adorable photo filters. Although we concede those are cute.
Entrepreneurship - You’re a self-starter who loves to own things end-to-end. You don’t ask for permission - you’re too busy making things happen.
Building good teams - Not managing them, building them. You know how to make those around you better and feed off their energy. You take care of your teammates.
WHY JOIN FORWARD?

We don’t want to just move dollars around the healthcare industry - we want to rebuild it and fix it. All of it. You’d be a major part of the story behind one of the most ambitious startup attempts of the past decade and you’d work with a team of people who want to use their talents for good.

Interested in building digital products and services for some of the biggest brands on the planet? We can't wait to hear from you!

About the role:

At Potato, best in class software development and human-centred design are at the heart of everything we do. We're a talented bunch of problem solvers who are committed to finding a better way; delivering smarter products that provide more satisfying experiences and more valuable outcomes for our clients and their users. Our clients include Google, Mozilla and the BBC.

As a design team, we want to appeal to both the head and the heart. As a designer we expect you to be able to constantly question and reassess both your own work and that of your team to make sure you're delivering the right kind of experience for the intended audience.

We know that designers come in many different flavours and acronyms. We're looking for someone who has the right mix of design thinking and practical skills, and is comfortable picking the right tools and activities for projects.

This role will see you working as part of a friendly, expert team, where everyone is responsible for the user experience of what we design and build. As cross-disciplinary teams, we all share the responsibility for bringing to life the concepts we create together. While pragmatism should always be in the back of your mind, we need people who can both champion their vision, but also be open to discussion while balancing both the practical and the inspirational.

Although we're based in the Bay Area, remote applicants are welcome and encouraged; we're also open to both contract and permanent candidates.

Lastly, we know the data. When applying for jobs, many women and non-binary folks feel they need to meet 100% of the criteria while men usually apply after meeting about 60%. If you think you'll be a good fit, please apply. We'd love to hear from you.

And to anyone working from home: kids, pets, and other cohabitators in the background are welcome!

About you:

Your portfolio should show that you are used to contributing to projects at all stages: participating in initial sketching brainstorms, meeting with clients, fleshing out creative concepts, crafting the experience across multiple channels and devices, and liaising with engineers to bring everything to fruition to your own exacting standards. You should have strong soft-skills and be confident presenting in front of clients and colleagues alike while thinking quickly.

Whether it's a rapid design and usability review of an existing app, or taking a project from requirements gathering to polished designs, prototypes and build, you should be able to demonstrate clear design thinking and a thorough understanding of design principles, underpinned with evidence wherever possible and appropriate.

You must have:

A portfolio with real world examples of projects you helped launch
A good understanding of design principles and their role in shaping design rationale
A good understanding of how the creative application of patterns, design systems, flows and services create products
Experience collaborating with Engineers
Experience designing with Figma/Sketch

Ideally, also:

Across three core Initiative focus areas of Science, Education and Justice and Opportunity, we're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and movement building, to help build an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.

Our Values


We believe we can help build a future for everyone.
We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.
We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.
Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.
Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

The Opportunity


By pairing engineers with leaders in our education, science, and justice and opportunity teams, we can bring technology to the table in new ways to help drive solutions. We are uniquely positioned to design, build, and scale software systems to help educators, scientists, and policy experts better address the myriad challenges they face. Our technology team is already helping schools bring personalized learning tools to teachers and schools across the country and supporting scientists around the world as they develop a comprehensive reference atlas of all cells in the human body.

Through advocacy, grantmaking, technology, and innovation, we work to drive change and build opportunities for those impacted by the justice system. As a Senior Product Designer for the Criminal Justice program of the Justice & Opportunity Initiative, you will create technology products for communities, advocates, and practitioners within the criminal justice system. In this role, you will help set the foundation for a suite of criminal justice products that will include:
Tools to support reform-minded prosecutors and improve prosecutorial decision-making
Applications to support our growing portfolio of second chances work, including our recently announced Clean Slate agenda.
You can read more about how CZI is thinking about the intersection of criminal justice and technology here in this Fast Company article.

You will
Partner closely with a cross-functional team to clearly understand human needs, and then translate them into meaningful product ideas that we can qualitatively test and quantitatively measure.
Work closely with PMs, engineers, and managers to frame and scope projects
Produce user flows that will solve problems and also drive the vision of the product
Bring designs to life through prototyping and working closely with engineering to implement designs
Introduce new design patterns or standards that will become adopted by others
Be an advocate for product quality
Play a key role in a growing our design team through craft leadership
You have
Experience designing and shipping products that demonstrate a high level of empathy for people using the product
Demonstrated leadership on end-to-end product design process from concept to implementation

We are a technical product that takes great pride in creating top-notch developer experiences. We’re looking for someone who loves both designing and programming, and is comfortable jumping between the two. If you don’t like being boxed into either front-end engineering or design jobs, this role is the perfect hybrid for you! We are striving to make technical, traditionally complicated concepts simple and fun to use. If you have a strong design background and are comfortable with code, we’d love to hear from you!

What we do

ReadMe helps companies build beautiful, personalized, and interactive developer hubs. We love what we do because it’s so much more than just docs. We’re providing tools for teams to create and manage beautiful documentation with ease. Last year, we raised a Series A led by Accel, which we’re pretty excited about!

We've written on our blog in the past about how we interview, and feel free to browse our other blog posts as well if it strikes your fancy!

‍♀️ Who we are
We're a small team of humans (and one owl) working together to do big things, and we’re growing! That’s where you come in. Since we’re a startup, you’ll have the opportunity to make a huge difference! You’ll have lots of opportunities and flexibility to make outsized improvements to ReadMe beyond your daily responsibilities.

-Tony grew up in San Francisco’s sunny Excelsior neighborhood and has trouble writing in third person. He used to collect *holographic* MUNI passes, but now just collects plants. Other interests include wearing all black, Marie Kondo-ing, and his dog.

-Marc grew up in the frozen tundra of northern Minnesota. Immediately after visiting SF he was already won over by warmer winter temperatures. Most of the time he can be found yelling at one of his cats to get out of the way of the TV.

Own all of the design elements of ReadMe. Everything from small components, to large features!
Take new products from conception to pixel-perfect designs.

Achieving this goal requires collaboration with teams of Designers, Researchers, Engineers and Product Managers throughout the design process—from creating user flows and wireframes to building user interface mockups and prototypes. At each stage, you will anticipate what our users need, advocate for them and ensure that the final product surprises and delights them.

We follow a simple but vital premise in the UX group: ""Focus on the user and all else will follow."" We're interested in our users and strive to learn everything we can about their behaviors, attitudes and emotions to help define the products and experiences we create. The UX team plays an integral part in gathering these insights and then using them to inspire and inform design. We are a multi-disciplinary team of interaction designers, visual designers, user researchers, content strategists and web developers who collaborate closely with each other and with engineering and product management to create innovative, usable, great-looking products that people love to use.

User experience is at the forefront of how we create intuitive, innovative, and beautiful products that people love. We strive to learn and understand our users’ needs, behaviors, and emotions to gather insights that inform product strategy and design. Our UX teams include designers, researchers, content strategists, and engineers who are passionate about quality, usability, and simplicity. We work on collaborative teams to solve complex challenges and craft experiences that highlight our products’ unique capabilities and personalities. Our work touches billions while exemplifying a key principle that is core to Google’s philosophy: “Focus on the user and all else will follow.”
Responsibilities
Collaborate with product managers, engineers, and cross-functional stakeholders to understand requirements, and provide creative, thoughtful solutions.
Communicate the user experience at various stages of the design process with wireframes, flow diagrams, storyboards, mockups, and/or high fidelity prototypes.
Integrate user feedback and business requirements into ongoing product experience updates.
Advocate for the prioritization of design centered changes, refinements, and improvements.

Imperfect Foods was founded in 2015 with a mission to reduce food waste and build a better food system for everyone. We offer imperfect (yet delicious) produce, affordable pantry items, and quality meat and dairy. We deliver them conveniently to our customers’ doorsteps and pride ourselves on offering up to a 30% discount compared to grocery store prices. Our customers can get the healthy, seasonal produce they want alongside the grocery staples they rely on, without having to compromise their budget or values. We’re proving that doing the right thing for the planet doesn’t have to cost more, and that shopping for quality ingredients can support the people and resources that it takes to grow our favorite foods.

We're headquartered in San Francisco with operations all over the country. Check our website to see if there is an Imperfect near you!

We're looking for folks who are positive, motivated, and ready to change the world. If that sounds like you, drop us a line!

How we are protecting employees from COVID-19

At Imperfect Foods, employee health and safety is our top priority. We have implemented processes and precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our facilities. We provide gloves, masks, and hand sanitizer to all essential employees who must report to work. Before entering our warehouse, employees have their temperatures checked. In addition, we take great care to ensure frequently touched surfaces are sanitized throughout the day and all warehouses are fully sanitized weekly.

We have also implemented an Emergency Sick Leave policy providing full-time and part-time employees 2 additional weeks of paid time off and up to 26 weeks paid leave if they have a confirmed case of COVID-19.

About the Role:

At Imperfect, our Product Design team exists to make grocery shopping a joy again. We imagine ways to take the chore out of meal planning, spend less time shopping, and get the most out of what we buy.

It can also be a choice: to shop consciously for a better planet.

We are looking for a passionate, creative Product Designer to join our team and help turn our mission into a reality by designing end-to-end experiences for the 400,000 customers (and growing!) that use Imperfect.

127,User experience designer,San Francisco,Product Designer,-1,"About Sidecar

Individual car ownership has dominated transportation for decades. What once stood for mobility, convenience, and expedition has given rise to high costs, sickening pollution, and crushing gridlock. We're here to rethink transportation through a commitment to human connection and shared experiences.

Sidecar’s ride marketplace connects everyday drivers in their own car with people nearby for safe and affordable rides. People can choose a ride based on vehicle, price and ETA using their smartphone.

In May 2014, Sidecar pioneered Shared Rides, which matches people with a nearby rider heading the same direction and cuts the cost in half.

Sidecar is available in ten U.S. markets and has completed millions of rides. Company investors include Union Square Ventures, Avalon Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Google Ventures and Sir Richard Branson.

About the Role

Please note that this role is not for a physical product or industrial designer, although we will consider candidates with that background who have ample experience in software design.

We’re seeking an experienced product designer to join our efforts in pushing the bounds of how technology enables transportation.The ideal candidate has a talent for all aspects of the design process, from research, to interaction and visual design.

This designer will partner with the product team and its two fellow designers to foster design culture and will help create beautiful visual systems that showcase a suite of world-class mobile products.

While product design is at the core of this role, a solid understanding of communication and the creative process is key. Collectively, the product and communication design teams serve as the creative core of the organization and collaborate to ensure the highest quality of deliverables to support a world-class experience.

About You

You’re passionate about design and creating products that customers adore. You enjoy talking and working with users to identify their pain points. You are receptive to feedback, can participate in productive debate via critiques and express unwavering humility throughout. You always keep in mind internal stakeholders when going through your design process. You like working in a multi-discipline team to effectively solve problems via technology, but ultimately understand that we're creating tools to enable human connection.

Food can be a part of a daily ritual or a special moment that resonates with people on a meaningful and emotional level. It can be a much-needed break in a long day, a taste that brings back memories, a creative experiment, a shared meal with loved ones, or even comfort during a hard time. Whether it's a special occasion or an everyday occurrence, it should always be easy for people to get the ingredients they need.

There’s a 1% chance an earthquake will cause $50 billion of insured loss within the next 12 months and a 5% chance that a hurricane will cause $60 billion of insured losses next year. At RMS, we turn risks into real numbers. How? By building simulation models that allow insurers and investors to understand and manage their global risks--from hurricanes, quakes, and wildfires, to cyberattacks, terror attacks, and pandemics. Why? We want to build a more resilient world, and we’re on a mission to help make every risk known.

Insurers, reinsurers, investors, financial institutions, governments, and NGOs trust RMS solutions to better understand and manage catastrophe risks.

In May 2019, we announced RMS Risk Intelligence™ (RI), an open-standard platform for strategic risk management. Through this purpose-built platform, clients can tap into RMS HD models, rich data layers, intuitive applications and APIs that simply integrate into existing enterprise systems to support business decisions across underwriting, risk selection, mitigation, and portfolio management.

Background
About 30-40% of food produced worldwide is thrown away, causing nearly a trillion dollars of economic losses, trillions of gallons of wasted water, and billions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions. In the US, about 40% of all food waste occurs at the retail level and downstream, largely driven by insufficient technology and manual processes.

Afresh seeks to tackle some of these big problems around food waste. Born out of Stanford's Computer Science PhD program, Afresh is the first Fresh food supply chain company. We bring the cutting edge of artificial intelligence to Fresh food to minimize food waste.

Our machine learning-powered supply chain solutions are tailored for the many nuances and complexities of perishables. Our first product is a store-level replenishment tool that optimizes the ordering of items in fresh categories -- produce, meat, deli, dairy, bakery, and prepared foods. The goal is to minimize waste and maximize in-stock rate, and consequently, profit.

So far, our results are in line with that goal! Our technology is deployed across the country and used every day—our customers have reduced their food waste by 33-50%+ and significantly improved their profits.

We're growing fast: we're in partnership with several large regional grocers representing 500+ stores and >$10B in revenue. Our backers include Innovation Endeavors (former Google CEO Eric Schmidt’s firm) and Baseline Ventures (first money in Stitchfix, SoFi, Heroku, Instagram).

We earnestly believe that Afresh represents a one-of-a-kind opportunity to have massive social impact, at profitable scale, by employing novel technology—and to have a ton of fun along the way.",5.0,"Afresh Technologies

Our client is the global leader in technology, with offices in many major cities. As different as those cities are, you can expect that the personality of each office is the same. Commonalities include bringing people together in the physical work space, outlets for creativity (outside work-related exercises), and a setup for brainstorming on the fly, whenever the opportunity strikes.

What they see in your resume, if you’re selected, is your ability to be an autonomous thinker, and a team player; someone focused, and driven to push the envelope who can also let down their guard and have fun with the team while doing it; someone who has the intellectual capacity to challenge even the most innovative thinkers without the hubris that tends to accompany it. No egos here!

Here, everyone is considered a project owner, and expected to give 100%, even when the path forward isn’t necessarily clear.

Work here, and know you’re working with a Forbes #1 rated company.

Work here, and know you’re setting the pace for digital products globally.

Work here, and find the challenge of your career!

And in case you’re afraid you won’t have time for other things, you’ll be able to take advantage of:

Fitness center access

Discounts on things like dry cleaning and oil changes

Free lunches

Convenient commuter shuttles
