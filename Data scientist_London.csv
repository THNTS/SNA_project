Simply Business is well prepared to deal with unprecedented events. We’re an agile business by nature – and our hiring and interview process is no exception. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, some parts of our hiring process may take a little longer than usual. Please bear with us, and rest assured that we're happy to hear from you and receive your application.

If it looks like you could be a good fit for the role, we’ll ask you to interview on Zoom – you’ll need WiFi and a laptop, or a 4G-enabled smartphone.

Technology. Award-winning customer service. Bleeding-edge data ability. Simply Business is a new type of insurance company, using all of the above to create the best possible insurance experience for small businesses and self-employed people. We love working here, and have even taken the number one spot in the Sunday Times Best Company To Work For 2015 and 16 lists; we’ve stopped entering now to focus on a few bigger projects, but you get the idea.

It’s a great place to work.

There are currently over 500,000 active Simply Business insurance policies in the UK alone. And we have offices in London, Northampton and Boston, USA. Talking of offices, ours are bright, airy and geared up for really smart working. We’re flexible, with plenty of remote workers coming in and out, and we believe work and life should be hand in hand, rather than a juggling act. So no need to worry about school pick-ups, or a horrible commute.

Our people are our most important asset, so we focus on building a working life that helps us thrive, not stick. We're proud of our inclusive and supportive culture, and we're passionate about creating an environment where everyone's cultural backgrounds, skills, and perspectives are valued. Join us and you’ll be part of our journey to creating something even better, for our customers and ourselves.

We need a Data Scientist to join us in London.

The Data Science team’s mission is to transform Simply Business into a leading InsurTech AI-ready company.
Simply Business already uses data to successfully deliver value and drive company strategy.
Over the years, we’ve built an impressive data capability based on cutting edge technologies, including AWS cloud services, Snowflake and Kafka.
We’re now working hard to successfully establish a data science function across the business to drive enhanced insight, better strategies and process automation.
As a Data Scientist you’ll:
build, maintain and extend data science products to support different areas of the business
work with the rest of the Data Science team to assess ideas and opportunities
discover data insights and share findings with the rest of the business
engage with technology and business teams to explain and illustrate data science concepts
Responsibilities include:
proactively proposing opportunities and ideas to apply data science in the business
communicating complex technical concepts to both tech and non-tech people
keeping up to date with the latest trends in data science
What we’re looking for:
at least two years experience as data scientist
demonstrable hands on experience with statistical data analysis and feature extraction
demonstrable experience designing, building, testing and maintaining ML models to solve business problems
proficient programming skills using Python libraries for data science
proficiency with data visualization and business storytelling
proficiency with SQL and data wrangling
strong presentation and communication skills
experience working with non-technical stakeholders
What are the benefits?

There’s all the serious (but important) stuff we call ‘core benefits’. On top of that, you can pick and choose from the more exciting options we offer – whether it’s a full gym membership, lifestyle pot, comprehensive private health cover, extra holiday or a National Trust pass.

The ‘core’ stuff
These are available to all staff from your first day. Here’s the summary:

• a salary that reflects your experience, our pay policy and the market we’re in from your first day
• an automatic enrolment pension (employer-matched at 5%)
• generous holiday entitlement
• life assurance – 4 x your basic salary
• a health cash plan to reimburse your everyday medical expenses
• an extra day off if you get married or move house
• unlimited access to 24/7 virtual GP
• bupa nurse healthline
• employee assistance programme (EAP)
• eye care vouchers
• local discounts

The fun stuff
We also have a great deal more to pick and mix from, with things like:

• a full gym membership
• lifestyle pot (a pot of cash to be used against anything you want need: well being, personal development, hobbies or childcare costs)
• private medical insurance
• extra days annual leave (up to 5 days)
• shopping vouchers
• dental insurance
• travel insurance
• merlin pass
• taste card

But there’s so much more to Simply Business than insurance and memberships. We also commit to flexible working options, smart working (our offices are kitted out for you to work when and how you choose), cycle to work, eye test vouchers, and season ticket loan schemes, and we have a handy online form to put in any training or conference requests.

Best of all, though, are the groups, clubs, and adventures that come with the Simply Business territory. Forget a simple Give As You Earn scheme (although we’ve got that too) – we trek the Sahara for charity, take you on weekends away, throw epic summer parties, and meet up for book groups, public speaking coaching, yoga, manicures, beer brewing, and lots, lots more.

Our values

Everything we do comes down to these five values – empowerment, authenticity, simplicity, learning and pioneering. In practice, these will mean something unique to every person at Simply Business, but if you’re considering working here, give them some thought. They’re at the heart of our story.

Empowerment
We're trusted to get the right stuff done in the way that suits us best

Authenticity
We respect the uniques skills and perspective that everyone has

Simplicity
If we can make it simpler, we do, and if we can’t then we explain it so everyone can understand

Learning
We’re always learning, developing and improving, and helping others do the same

Data at Bud


The data team is tasked with solving highly analytical problems to enable solutions that tangibly benefit the lives of millions of people. From what data we need to collect to solve problems, to working with that data to glean insights and guide our decision making, the analyst is a key resource at Bud that is highly valued. Data is key to our business and we need passionate analysts to help research and analyse data to push us forward.

What else would be good to know


The data teams each meet weekly for a 30m 'Fika' break (borrowed from Swedish culture) where work talk is forbidden. We share food and snacks and get to know each other on a personal level.

What is it like to work for Bud?


We could play buzzword bingo but one of our core values is 'Authentic' and the best way to demonstrate this is by sharing our employee engagement dashboard. This provides a weekly engagement and NPS score giving you a true reflection of life at Bud. All data collected is realtime & anonymised so we have no control over what you see.

The dashboard is interactive so check it out here and have a look at what the numbers mean, https://bit.ly/2MhjAZT

At the moment we have remote events which change often depending on what the teams are interested in.

A bit more about us


We’re a diverse group of people. With backgrounds ranging from data science to music production, more than 80% of our team come from outside the world of finance – providing us with a unique perspective as we help consumers feel more in control of their lives. For us, an interest in people comes first; finance follows.

More about what we're doing


The apps and infrastructure we’re building are designed to place the power of personal data back into the hands of normal people. Picture this: a world where your bank knew you were paying too much for your gas bill and could switch you to a more suitable provider, or understood your savings targets and could automatically find you a better deal. That’s what we’re working towards.

We believe that diversity will make us better.


Bud’s mission is to make the money part of people’s lives simple. To get there, we need a workforce that is diverse as the people we create our products for. Which means we need people who have different backgrounds and experiences, who are diverse in age, gender identity, race, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, ethnicity, and ways of thinking. We truly believe that these differences will make us grow as a company and a team. We strive to create a workplace and culture where our people are empowered, supported, given equal opportunities and can bring their authentic selves to work.

Who we are

At MADE.COM we believe that everyone should have access to great design. So, we’ve taken a unique approach to making and selling furniture - no middlemen, no agents or importers and no high street stores. Instead we work directly with designers and manufacturers so we can offer high-end furniture at attractive prices.

It’s not an easy task – it takes a creative and dedicated team to make it happen where everyone has an important part to play. We combine our individual passions and skills to create innovative work that’s as exciting and unconventional as the business itself. It’s a place where all ideas are listened to, where brainstorming means job titles get left at the door and where a self-starter can really make their mark.

Our backend system keeps track of every item of stock, whether it’s in production, on a boat, or at a delivery hub. This allows us to eliminate dormant stock and produce big ticket items as close to on-demand as possible, allowing us to make over 1500 new products this year alone. As a company we seek a competitive edge; as technologists and craftsmen we’re no different. We’ve embraced event-driven architectures, DDD, and CQRS in order to achieve our technical goals. We’re trail-blazers in the Python community, and we contribute back by writing and talking about our findings and open-sourcing our tools.

Analytics team supports multiple streams of the business with some exceptionally successful projects from stock ordering forecasting and optimisation to marketing bidding engine optimisation. And we plan to continue investment into areas that activate the value of DATA. We currently use Google Cloud tools primarily for our internal Data Platform such as BigQuery and Cloud Composer. All our code is executed in the Cloud through DAGs which allows the team to build highly scalable data pipelines and deliver business value efficiently.

Hi! We are Ravelin! We're a fraud detection company using advanced machine learning and network analysis technology to solve big problems. Our goal is to make online transactions safer and help our clients feel confident serving their customers.
And we have fun in the meantime! We are a friendly bunch and pride ourselves in having a strong culture and adhering to our values of empathy, ambition, unity and integrity. We really value work/life balance and we embrace a flat hierarchy structure company-wide. Join us and you’ll learn fast about cutting-edge tech and work with some of the brightest and nicest people around - check out our Glassdoor reviews.
If this sounds like your cup of tea, we would love to hear from you! For more information check out our blog to see if you would like to help us prevent crime and protect the world's biggest online businesses.

The Team
You will be joining the Detection team. The Detection team is responsible for keeping fraud rates low – and clients happy – by continuously training and deploying machine learning models. We aim to make model deployments as easy and error free as code deployments. Google’s Best Practices for ML Engineering is our bible.
Our models are trained to spot multiple types of fraud, using a variety of data sources and techniques in real time. The prediction pipelines are under strict SLAs, every prediction must be returned in under 300ms. When models are not performing as expected, it’s down to the Detection team to investigate why.
The Detection team is core to Ravelin’s success. They work closely with the Data Engineering Team who build infrastructure and the Intelligence & Investigations Team who liaise with clients.

The Role
We are currently looking for a Data Scientist to help train, deploy, debug and evaluate our fraud detection models. Our ideal candidate is pragmatic, approachable and filled with knowledge tempered by past failures.
Evaluating fraud models is hard; often times we do not even get labels for 3 months. You’ll need to use your judgement when investigating cases of ambiguous fraud and when you’re investigating the veracity of the model itself.
We have to build robust models that are capable of updating their beliefs when they encounter new methods of fraud: our clients expect us to be one step ahead of fraud, not behind. You will be given the equipment, space and guidance you need to build world class fraud detection models.
The work is not all green field research. The everyday work is about making safe incremental progress towards better models for our clients. The ideal candidate is willing to get involved in both aspects of the job – and understand why both are important.

Responsibilities
Build out our model evaluation and training infrastructure.
Develop and deploy new models to detect fraud whilst maintaining SLAs
Write new features in our production infrastructure
Research new techniques to disrupt fraudulent behaviour
Investigate model performance issues (using your experience of debugging models).


Requirements
Experience building and deploying ML models using the Python data stack (numpy, pandas, sklearn).
Strong analytical skills.
Being a strong collaborator with colleagues outside of your immediate team, for example with client support teams or engineering.
Being skilled at communicating complex technical ideas to a range of audiences.
The ability to prioritise and to manage your workload.
Being comfortable working remotely. While we are working towards getting everyone back in to the office, it is likely that the first several weeks of your time at Ravelin will be characterised by you or many of your colleagues working remotely. The ability to be effective in these circumstances will therefore be vital.
Nice to haves
Understand software engineering best practices (version control, unit tests, code reviews, CI/CD) and how they apply to machine learning engineering.
Tensorflow and deep learning experience
Experience with Kubernetes and ML production infrastructure.
Experience with Go, C++, Java or another systems language.


Benefits
Competitive salary & equity package
A minimum of 25 days annual leave + bank holidays
Flexible working hours
Individual learning and development allowance of £1,000/year
Remote volunteer opportunities and monthly company charity donations
Fortnightly team lunches with different people from across the company (currently via video chat!)

ProFinda
Headquarters: London, UK
https://profinda.com

ProFinda is a software company pioneering “Workforce Optimisation”. This emerging £2.8bn software category will transform organisational productivity and the employee talent agenda. With our unique technology, our global clients and channel partnerships we are entering a massively exciting growth phase.

ProFinda is headquartered in London. Since going live in 2011, ProFinda has become an award-winning enterprise technology solution with a focus on professional services and other knowledge-driven industries.

These organisations have been spending millions on talent systems that haven’t given them the information they need about their own employee’s skills, let alone their total talent pool including contingent and alumni workers. As a result, employees are left unengaged and under-utilised while these organisations spend more money sourcing contingent workers to fill the gap, and not necessarily the right ones.

ProFinda is a workforce optimisation platform that maps the skills, knowledge, and expertise available across an organisation's total talent supply chain of internal, contingent and alumni workers.

By implementing ProFinda a company can now far better match their available talent internally and externally with the right opportunities at the right time, increasing engagement, productivity, and efficiency while decreasing costs. We use our proprietary skills ontology and machine learning to build an accurate knowledge base of the skills and experiences of employees, contractors, and alumni for major enterprises.

We believe we are changing the way companies think about their people and the way people think about their own careers, by making the total talent pool a reality. To take customers on this journey we need to win their confidence, excel at delivery and continually delight them as the product grows and changes. We treat each client like they were our first and want to find people who are as passionate as we are about client’s successes.

What we are looking for

We're looking for a Data Scientist with 5 or more years of demonstrable experience to work with our Intelligence team on building a semantic, local-grammar based system.

This is a full time role and we would expect the successful candidate to spend at least two days a week in the London Office with the option to work from home on the other days.

As part of your role you will be able to architect and solve complex problems with the best tools you can find. You will research and develop Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning algorithms, along with existing libraries usage and will be responsible for new ways of data usage discovery. You will also assist in product development, looking at things from a data perspective and be responsible for key textual data problems, suggestions and deep search.

Skills & Requirements:

· An experience with advanced application architectures (5+ years)

· Experience working with UniTex

· Keen interest in cutting-edge ML/NLP solutions and technologies

· Experience with Ruby, Python or Java will help but we can help you learn these if your experience in another language is good

· Experience with AWS services

· Knowledge of search systems (like Elasticsearch)

· The ability to quickly mockup a solution using one of common ML/NLP libraries (like OpenNLP, Gensim, NLTK and so on)

· An ability to draft a service for subsequent usage by other team members

· Strong Database knowledge (relational, non-relational and graph)

· Familiarity with using REST APIs

· Good writing skills, with a passion for documenting

· Excellent knowledge of English (spoken and written)

Who we are

At MADE.COM we believe that everyone should have access to great design. So, we’ve taken a unique approach to making and selling furniture - no middlemen, no agents or importers and no high street stores. Instead we work directly with designers and manufacturers so we can offer high-end furniture at attractive prices.

It’s not an easy task – it takes a creative and dedicated team to make it happen where everyone has an important part to play. We combine our individual passions and skills to create innovative work that’s as exciting and unconventional as the business itself. It’s a place where all ideas are listened to, where brainstorming means job titles get left at the door and where a self-starter can really make their mark.

What you’ll be doing

We are looking for someone who can take and drive the data science capability of the Analytics team. As our Lead Data Scientist, you will be mentoring a team of data scientists and analysts who will be participating in different projects within cross-functional teams. You will be focused on delivery of the business impact through scalable production ready data solutions which can vary from machine learning, data pipelines to advanced visualisation tools.

Technology and innovation are two key factors in our success. Our platform allows us to manufacture in any of over 150 locations, and ship multiple items from one basket seamlessly. Our backend system keeps track of every item of stock, whether it’s in production, on a boat, or at a delivery hub. This allows us to eliminate dormant stock and produce big ticket items as close to on-demand as possible, allowing us to make over 1500 new products this year alone. As a company we seek a competitive edge; as technologists and craftsmen we’re no different. We’ve embraced event-driven architectures, DDD, and CQRS in order to achieve our technical goals. We’re trail-blazers in the Python community, and we contribute back by writing and talking about our findings and open-sourcing our tools.

Analytics team supports multiple streams of the business with some exceptionally successful projects from stock ordering forecasting and optimisation to marketing bidding engine optimisation. And we plan to continue investment into areas that activate the value of DATA. We currently use Google Cloud tools primarily for our internal Data Platform such as BigQuery and Cloud Composer. All our code is executed in the Cloud through DAGs which allows the team to build highly scalable data pipelines and deliver business value efficiently.

Initial areas of responsibility will include:

Data Science
Research process. You will define and support the research and analytical process that will deliver rigorous business insights.
Perform modeling. You will be responsible for advanced statistical and machine learning modeling in various areas of the business. You will develop data driven analytical tools to make results of your models available to users.

At Deliveroo we have a world class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.
Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.
Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.
Our data scientists come from many disciplines including mathematics, statistics, economics/econometrics, physics, psychology, finance, computer science, operations research, cognitive neuroscience and engineering. Some are formally trained in data science, some are not. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.
Data Science at Deliveroo
We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

About the Role
As an Economist in the Data Science organisation at Deliveroo you will help scale our business and improve the experience for restaurants, riders, and eaters. Using experimental or observational data, you will get to help answer questions like:
Which markets/cities should we enter next?
How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?
What is the business impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?
How do we best optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?
How does a new competitor’s entry into one of our markets affect our growth ambitions?
Can the Delivery food market sustain multiple players?
What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants?
What impact do online reviews have?
How will a change in the user interface affect customer choice behavior?
The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.
Qualifications:
Always curious and willing to learn new skills
A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset
Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business-relevant economic problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail
Masters degree or PhD (preferred) in Economics or Econometrics
Ideally industry experience since the completion of your academic career
Proficiency with analytical tools like R/Python and familiarity with SQL
Ability to understand and design markets and incentives taking into account the information environment and strategic interactions
Excellent people skills — you’ll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into economic problems.

Benefits and Diversity
At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.",3.5,"Deliveroo

About The Team

The Managed Rules Team is working on building the best in class Web Application Firewall (WAF). We do this by maintaining the rules that make up the WAF (based on wirefilter) and proactively looking for the next vulnerabilities across levels 3-7 of the OSI Model. We can do this by using our massive amounts of data, and work in tandem with vendors to add WAF-based protections before vulnerabilities are disclosed. We accomplish these goals by building the next generation of tools to quickly identify and address vulnerabilities. In response our tooling enables us to iterate quickly on rules, as well as deploying with confidence to our millions of customers. We are a polyglot team that utilizes Rust, Go, and Python to build our services and tools.

What Makes Cloudflare Special?

We're not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We're a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare's enterprise customers--at no cost.

Athenian Project: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy policy and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

An exciting opportunity has arisen for a Data Scientist to join the Cancer Research UK Grand Challenge Project ‘Mutographs’ on a Fixed Term Contract until May 2022 (with the possibility of extension). We are looking for a new team member to help us analyse cancer genomes collected from around the world in this ambitious and high profile project.
Mutographs is a large, international, multidisciplinary project, led by Professor Mike Stratton. The project was funded in 2017 in the first round of Cancer Research UK Grand Challenge projects. The project aims to explain major global differences in cancer incidence, through analysis of cancer samples from 5,000 patients, covering 5 different types of cancer, and collected across 5 continents.
We are approximately half way through this project and are looking for someone to join the team to help us analyse cancer DNA sequence data from Work Package 1 by ‘chaperoning’ data through an existing data analysis pipeline. This role is computer-based and full training by existing team members will be provided.
You will work remotely at least for the remainder of 2020 and likely beyond, depending on Government guidelines. You will be welcomed into a team that has been successfully working from home since March 2020, we have experience with on-boarding people remotely and have regular formal and informal meetings to ensure all members of the team continue to feel engaged and motivated in this exciting project. You will work closely with the Mutographs scientists, bioinformaticians and project manager and informally with a wider team from the Cancer, Ageing and Somatic Mutation Programme at the Sanger Institute.
About you
The position would suit a graduate (or equivalent experience) who is interested in genomics and/or cancer biology, wishes to learn or develop their skills in analysing NGS sequencing data and who enjoys responsibility for their own area of work, but within the nurturing environment of a strong team.
We are looking for a team player and effective communicator who works well with others and can also work independently (once trained) to a high level of detail and diligence. Once trained, the successful applicant will be able to manage their own workload and timing, but with structured weekly reporting to the Mutographs scientist and project manager. This is a computer based role and the core work can be repetitive, however there will be opportunity for variation and regular meetings to break up the day/week. The role does not require coding or software development experience as the analytical pipelines are already in place. You will be required to review analysis results via a web interface, interpreting and making decisions based on visual analysis outputs.
Applications from individuals wishing to work part time are welcome (minimum of 20 hours per week, please give an indication of hours in your covering letter).
Interested candidates may contact the Mutographs project manager, Laura Humphreys (lp5@sanger.ac.uk), for further information.

translate regulatory reporting requirements into highly accurate data models and set the strategy for how we ensure the best possible data accuracy
build robust data models, reports and visualisations downstream of backend services (mostly in BigQuery SQL) that support internal management information as well as governance and regulatory reporting
investigate and effectively work with colleagues from other disciplines to address and improve data quality
integrate new data sources into our data warehouse
design, build and launch new data pipelines in production

You should apply if
you have strong SQL skills and are familiar with BigQuery and/or general data warehousing concepts
you are comfortable exploring potentially ambiguous business problems and enjoy finding technical solutions to them
you have experience building robust and reliable data sets requiring a high level of control
you're keen to learn more about new technologies and their application in retail banking
you strive for improvement, proactively identifying issues and opportunities and getting them prioritised
It would be a bonus if:
You have multiple years of analytics experience, preferably in a fast moving tech company or consultancy
Experience working with governance reporting or financial crime
Logistics
We can help you relocate to London & we can sponsor visas.
This role can be based in our London office or remotely within the UK
We offer flexible working hours and trust you to work enough hours to do your job well, at times that suit you and your team.
Diversity and inclusion is a priority for us – if we want to solve problems for people around the world, our team has to represent our customers. So we need to attract the best talent and create an environment that supports and includes them. You can read more about diversity and inclusion on our blog.
If you prefer to work part-time, we'll make this happen whenever we can - whether this is to help you meet other commitments or strike a great work-life balance.
The application process consists of a 30 min phone call with a recruiter, an initial call with someone from the team, followed by a practical written exercise and 2-3 video interviews. We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions.

Data Science at Deliveroo
At Deliveroo we have a world-class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.
There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.
Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.
Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

Further, we have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.

About the Role
In this role, you will be designing and building the algorithmic and machine-learning systems that power Deliveroo. You will be working in a cross-functional team alongside engineers, data scientists specialized in algorithms and inference, and product managers to develop systems that make automated decisions at massive scale. Your team has a high degree of autonomy and works at some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants. We evaluate the performance of all our decision making machines via robust experimentation powered by our world class experimentation platform.
We are looking for a data scientist from an algorithms background, to build intelligent decision making machines. These machines may:
Optimise our delivery network by making rider assignment decisions; predicting how long a leg of the delivery journey will take; or mitigating real time delays
Work out how many riders we need in a particular place at a particular time
Optimise consumer and rider fees
Optimise the consumer experience by showing the most relevant restaurants and dishes
Detect fraud and abuse from consumers, riders, and restaurants
Assist restaurants in optimising their presence on Deliveroo, for example by recommending that they improve their menus or photography, or add a popular dish
Create an ML platform to improve our ML and optimisation capabilities


Requirements:
You are someone who knows the fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research and knows when they should be applied.
You are a keen problem solver, able to think deeply about a business problem and devise a well-thought-out and pragmatic algorithmic solution. And you get satisfaction from seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.
Previous experience applying machine learning/operations research to business problems in industry
Strong foundation in fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research
Proficient in exploratory data analysis, model/algorithm selection, model pipeline development. Deploying models to production and experiment monitoring is a bonus.
Solid communication skills - in person, in writing, in code, and code-review; to technical and non-technical audiences
Comfortable working in a fast-moving environment with changing requirements
A pragmatic approach, biased to simplicity, where you most care about achieving impact

Benefits and Diversity
At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander.

About Cuvva
We’re making insurance radically better. How? By building insurance that’s fair and flexible.

Insurance is completely broken. It’s outdated, complicated, rigid – and we get it, insurance (as you know it) doesn’t sound very exciting. But we’re doing things differently. Using pretty cool technology, we’re making insurance way more fit for the 21st century, building products that actually solve problems.

We were the first company in the UK to sell hourly car insurance via an app. And we’re also the only insurance provider that provides in-app customer support with an average one minute response time. We’ve sold over 2 million policies and supported over 300,000 customers. We’re a strong, talented team of 80+ and growing.

Why work for Cuvva?
We don’t cut corners. We strive to do the right thing, even when that makes life more difficult for us.

We’ve nurtured an awesome team culture. We always speak up when we have an idea - but also know when to let go and get behind something else.

And we’re comfortable giving and receiving honest feedback, and trying new ways of doing things.

We’re building a diverse team from different backgrounds, outlooks and experiences. Everyone is given a fair chance of getting a role at Cuvva. Even if you secretly don’t love insurance, trust us, you’ll love what we’re building.

And if you need any adjustments or support when you’re applying at Cuvva, no worries. Just let us know.

About Cuvva
A new kind of insurance
We started with a problem: nobody was offering short-term car insurance by the hour.
But we soon realised insurance isn't just lacking. It's completely broken. It's built on layers of middlemen and outdated systems. So Cuvva turned from a simple idea into a full-blown mission: to offer insurance the way it should be.

We think insurance should be fast, flexible and clear. So we've cut out the middlemen, ditched the jargon and put our heart and soul into customer support.",3.5,"Cuvva

About the Role
At Deliveroo we have a world class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.
Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.
Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.
Our data scientists come from many disciplines including mathematics, statistics, economics/econometrics, physics, psychology, finance, computer science, operations research, cognitive neuroscience and engineering. Some are formally trained in data science, some are not. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

As a data scientist at Deliveroo, your main goal is business impact. You will help answer questions like:
Which markets/cities should we enter next?
How should we improve our consumer, rider, and restaurant apps?
How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?
What is the business impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?
How do we best optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?
How does a new competitor’s entry into one of our markets affect our growth ambitions?
Can the food delivery market sustain multiple players?
What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
How should we make investment decisions company-wide?
How should we decide which rider to assign to a given order?
Which restaurants should we show a given customer?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?
What impact do online reviews have?
How will a change in the user interface affect customer choice behaviour?
The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

Data Science at Deliveroo
We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them. There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind?
At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Qualifications:
Always curious and willing to learn new skills
Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences
A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset
Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail
Proficiency with analytical tools like R/Python and familiarity with SQL
A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact
Excellent people skills — you’ll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into data science problems

Benefits and Diversity
At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.",3.5,"Deliveroo

We use Django rest framework and Postgresql to provide our primary REST API interface. Our web-app is built using react. AWS SQS queues are then used to distribute work to a variety of processing systems / microservices which use a combination of commodity analytics APIs (e.g. aws transcribe, google speech, aws rekognition) and bespoke algorithms and models (e.g. tensorflow) to provide speech, image and video analytics.
As you would expect our system also provides various collaboration, administration, management and security related features around the central video capture and analytics.
We offer both shared and dedicated deployments of the software; by defining all of our infrastructure as code we are able to easily deploy dedicated copies of our entire system into dedicated VPCs for our large customers. Many of our customers have stringent security requirements around their video data.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

We are committed to addressing the diversity problem in the tech industry, and that starts with making sure we have a team where everyone feels at home and can contribute as a peer.

Job description

Summary

We are looking for a motivated and high-achieving Data Scientist – Causality Expert based in London to join the team on our vision to optimise every business on the planet. This is a full-time placement with significant opportunities for personal development.

We offer an intellectually stimulating environment, work within an interdisciplinary team and an inclusive culture. We are a high-calibre, mission-driven team building a technology that improves our world.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

We are committed to addressing the diversity problem in the tech industry, and that starts with making sure we have a team where everyone feels at home and can contribute as a peer.

238,Data scientist,London,Research Scientist Evidence Synthesis,-1,"Project Lead / Research Scientist (Systematic Literature Review) – Meta Research
*There are two Research Scientist openings. We are looking to fill these roles in our London, UK office; however, we will consider other locations based on the candidates’ experience and qualifications.
The Team

Just about anyone seeking published articles to answer research questions can type terms into a database and then hope to make sense of the information retrieved. But when done without the right knowledge, skills, and experience, such an exercise risks answers that are biased, confusing, incomplete, or wholly incorrect. Poorly designed search algorithms, unworkable PICOS criteria and failure to follow PRISMA study-reporting guidelines are just a few of many things that often go wrong with such attempts at literature reviewing. This helps explain what makes Meta Research different. We offer broad clinical knowledge and expertise in finding and assessing complex information. This means our clients and Evidera colleagues can rely on us to discover, synthesize, and contextualize the data that really matter and thereby provide them with insights they could not have obtained by themselves. Here are just some of the things we help our clients and colleagues do:
Understand new indications in context of specific product strategy
Inform planning for primary research, such as choice of patient-reported outcome instruments and comparators
Estimate clinical comparisons of products versus competitors
Capitalize on existing research while assessing evidence gaps
Provide information for value development planning
Determine which databases have proved useful in target indications
Derive model inputs
Create burden-of-illness assessments for submission to payers
Publish burden assessments for dissemination
Populate dossiers
Populate regulatory documents such as Risk Management Plans.
The Role
You’re different. You understand and can explain convincingly why systematic literature reviews are crucial. And you have that rare combination of technical knowhow, experience and enthusiasm necessary to successfully lead such research. That’s what we’ll want from you as a Research Scientist in our Meta Research team. Perhaps you’re skilled too in network meta-analysis (NMA) and/or epidemiology, and so will add to the team’s strengths in these or other specialist areas. But whatever your specific background and interests, you’ll be able to help ensure that the team’s thinking and approach to systematic literature reviews take account of cutting-edge research and best scientific and consulting practice. In addition, as a principal investigator on individual literature review projects and subsequent analyses, you’ll direct, oversee and have overall responsibility for all aspects of study design and execution. A natural collaborator, you’ll provide clients with strategic consultation and advice on how best to address research needs, and work closely with and guide project managers and other research associates in delivering the required studies. Specific accountabilities of the Research Scientist role are detailed below.

You will:

Design and implement systematic and targeted literature reviews and further analysis.
Conceptualize advanced study designs and develop study protocols.
Lead interactions with clients in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.
Have final responsibility for project budgets, deliverables and timelines; and identify scope expansion and need for amendments.
Review and finalize project deliverables and ensure study findings are valid and reliable.
Participate in business development, including input into proposal review, kick-off meetings and bid defense meetings by reviewing key challenges and suggesting solutions.
Support sales through methodological excellence (systematic reviews and/or NMAs)
Review, track and own annual sales target

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

We are committed to addressing the diversity problem in the tech industry, and that starts with making sure we have a team where everyone feels at home and can contribute as a peer.

Job Introduction

Back in 2017, we started a new development team at Reach PLC, called Emerging Products, which operates entirely lean, Innovation-driven, and focuses relentlessly on rapid Innovation to discover new business models in the Publishing Industry. Our first successful experiment is a product called InYourArea.co.uk, a hyperlocal news and data aggregator that shows you what is happening in your neighbourhood, and connects you with your neighbours.

We are looking for a Data Engineer to work on our InYourArea platform, working closely with our data scientists, a larger team of web developers and the Head of Product.

We breathe our values of Collaboration, Determination, Imagination and Customer Focus, underpinning the work our talented employees produce every single day, from editorial and HR, to technology and print. We strongly believe in the benefits of flexible working and autonomy in our day to day jobs.

So, who are we?

You might not have heard of us but we have probably met without you even realising it. Reach plc is home to the UK and Ireland’s most iconic digital platforms, magazines and newspapers. From the Mirror, Daily Express and OK!, to our regional titles such as the Liverpool Echo, BirminghamLive and the Manchester Evening News (plus lots more), our brands and the stories we cover are as varied as our people. We help all kinds of people share experiences through our stories because we believe this is what makes us human. Oh, and we should probably also mention that with a monthly readership of 47 million people, Reach is the largest commercial publisher in the UK. At Reach, not only will you feel better understood, you will also feel you understand other people better too.

Key Responsibilities

What will the role involve?

As a Data Engineer, you will be responsible for participating in technology decisions and the design of data infrastructure. You will help build data-driven features and models, and help us develop best practices around how we work with data. We are looking for a talented, self-motivated individual who can quite simply get stuff done.

The Ideal Candidate

Who are we looking for?

You need to be fluent in Python. Commercial experience in building scalable data infrastructure and data processing frameworks will be highly appreciated but we are keen on helping you grow into this role.

We use AWS extensively, and we provision our own resources (using Cloudformation), so experience with AWS and Cloudformation or similar Infrastructure-As-Code tools would be beneficial.

Our main operational data stores rely on MongoDB and DynamoDB. Our S3 data lake is exposed to the team via Athena and Spark, with Superset as our tool bench. Finally we rely on Scrapy to ingest news articles from large and small publications across the country to populate our users’ feed in real-time. Previous experience with those technologies would be helpful but is not required.

Package Description

In addition to competitive salaries, 25 days annual leave (plus bank holidays), bonus structures (if applicable) and a contributory pension scheme, Reach plc have a wealth of flexible benefits on offer. These include a holiday purchase scheme, cycle scheme, a technology scheme in conjunction with Curry’s PC World, car scheme, health cash plan, employee loans and lots of high street discounts.

Reach plc believe diversity brings benefits for our customers, our business and our people. This is why we are committed to being an inclusive employer and encourage applications from all suitable applicants irrespective of background, circumstances, age, disability, gender identity, ethnicity, religion or belief and sexual orientation. Our business is fully committed to health and wellbeing in the workplace with an employee assistance programme and trained mental health first aiders across the business.

Data Science at Deliveroo

We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.",3.5,"Deliveroo
