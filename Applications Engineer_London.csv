We build a cutting-edge DevOps solution for the millions of developers building applications on Salesforce, the world's biggest enterprise PaaS. In a few short years, Gearset has become the DevOps solution of choice for some of the world’s biggest companies, including IBM, McKesson, and even Salesforce themselves.

From the start, we’ve focused on providing truly outstanding support to all our users. Our focus on delighting our users in every interaction is one of the main reasons for our success. It differentiates us from the competition.

What’s the opportunity?

We’re looking for a Customer Support Engineer to join our Customer Success team. This is a very hands-on, technical role, that is much broader than a typical ticket-based support position. If you’re driven by understanding how things work, committed to delivering a great customer experience, and able to digest and explain complex topics, our customer success team is right for you.

You’ll ensure everyone who interacts with Gearset receives world-class customer support. From answering the in-app chat to jumping on technical calls, you’ll be unrelentingly focused on going above and beyond for our users: diagnosing and solving issues, guiding them through the product, and soliciting feedback to help us continually improve. Our approach to support is friendly, personal, and fun, and you’ll engage in dynamic conversations without relying on predetermined scripts or automated bots.

You’ll work in a cross-functional team of developers, salespeople, and marketers, proactively diving into unfamiliar technical topics to become an expert, and clearly and succinctly summarising them to educate and guide, ultimately ensuring users get the most from Gearset. You’ll act as the bridge between our users and our product teams to ensure we’re acting on their feedback and continually driving the development of the product.

After an initial training period on UK hours, you’ll work US East Coast hours (2pm - 10pm UK), helping support our global user base.
Working at Gearset, you will:
Act as the first point of call for users with questions about Gearset, prioritising and responding to their questions through in-app chat, by email, and on technical screen-shares
Debug complex issues by developing a deep understanding of Gearset, Salesforce, our users, and their challenges
Provide consultative support and advice to our users on how to best use Gearset and streamline their development process
Be a customer champion, ensuring their views are represented in the company
Influence product development by working closely with our product, marketing, and sales teams to collect and digest user feedback
Maintain a laser focus on quality, with top-notch written and spoken communication
Contribute to our support documents to ensure they’re clear and accurate, and research and write new content to fill any gaps
You’ll be a good fit if you have:
A bachelor's degree or equivalent direct work experience
A technical predisposition, and the desire to learn
Demonstrable exceptional writing skills and attention to detail
A can-do attitude with a focus on delighting users
The ability to convey complex technical topics with simplicity
User empathy, and an aptitude for using this to foster user relationships that resonate and engage
Excellent organisation and prioritisation skills
Previous experience in technical support roles or problem solving in a technical environment would be beneficial

59,Applications Engineer,London,"Software Engineer, GPU Performance, Research Platform Team",-1,"Snapshot

We're looking for a Software Engineer who is interested in helping us leverage GPU accelerators to support AGI research. No machine learning knowledge is required for this role!

About Us

DeepMind's mission is to ""Solve intelligence. Use it to make the world a better place.""

The Research Platform team's objective is ""Effortless Artificial General Intelligence Research"". We are a core group of ~60 SWEs within DeepMind Research who work to provide a best-in-class research workflow. We build tools, infrastructure, libraries, frameworks, services, and products to enable and accelerate the next generation of research ideas.

Our team plays a critical role in the mission of DeepMind in multiple ways. In the simplest form, improving the workflow has a super-linear impact on research efficiency, as not only does it free up more time - but the extra cognitive space can allow new research ideas to thrive that would otherwise never happen.

Many recent breakthroughs in AI research were made possible by the vast amounts of computational power from new hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs. As a Software Engineer working on GPU Performance you can help us provide the best hardware platform for AI research and make it easy to use efficiently for our researchers.

The role

DeepMind researchers rely on powerful hardware accelerators to run their experiments, train their models, and discover new breakthroughs. Accelerators are complex systems with ad-hoc software layers & APIs to program them. They can be hard to use effectively.

Your job is to work across the entire AI software stack to enable our researchers to make ever faster progress towards our mission. You will look at all components that influence performance: from tensor programming frameworks, such as TensorFlow and JAX, to compilers, such as XLA and MLIR, to hardware, such as (but not limited to) GPUs, to networking, using technologies such as NCCL and MPI. You will work with researchers to understand their needs and explore potential solutions, implementing what's needed to achieve higher computational performance.

The responsibilities that you will have include:

Diagnosing, debugging and fixing systems & GPU performance issues using appropriate tools and techniques.
Writing and optimizing custom computational kernels for GPUs.
Designing and developing new approaches for high-performance computing and parallel computing on hardware accelerators
Contributing to the design and the implementation of solutions to common performance problems
About you

What we are looking for:

You comfortably program GPU accelerators, achieving high levels of throughput and efficiency with your implementations.

You are able to profile software running on GPUs, using appropriate tools and techniques to find performance issues & bottlenecks.

You use and modify compiler infrastructure (such as NVCC, LLVM, MLIR, XLA) to improve performance on hardware accelerators. You might have experience using these tools or extending and modifying them.

You might have experience writing distributed GPU applications, using NCCL2, NCCL or MPI, and debugging performance issues with such applications.

You take the initiative and assume responsibility for solving technical problems. You can drive multiple stages of software projects - from requirements gatherings to launch and validation. You often look for what can be improved and you have a proactive attitude in helping our researchers.

You work well within teams. You have worked on multi-person software projects and/or on open source projects. You participate in technical discussions, ask insightful questions, and work with the team to pull together scoping, schedules, and solutions to issues.

You are a good communicator. You know how to document software and standard methodologies. You clearly and effectively communicate your ideas, your work, and your results to team members, team leaders and senior managers.

You have an interest in our mission and AI / Machine Learning.

Qualities that are an asset
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, a related technical field, or equivalent practical experience.
Experience with programming in C/C++.
Experience with coding GPUs (CUDA).
Experience with large distributed systems and NCCL or MPI.
Experience with debugging GPU performance issues.
Experience in parallel programming and high-performance computing.
Familiarity with Python.
Interest in AI and basic knowledge of AI algorithms.
What we offer

You will join a diverse and vibrant environment where you can influence and have impact on groundbreaking research results. You will enjoy a creative and stimulating work environment and direct access to world-class researchers!

We constantly iterate on our work environment. It has been crafted to help you lead a balanced life. This goes from providing you excellent facilities (healthy food, music rooms, gym, faith rooms, terraces, spacious desks, etc) to enabling your manager to make special work arrangements if you need them. Our managers are being supported by our People and Culture team to ensure we do our best to suit your needs. We provide baby bonding leaves for both parents. Our list of arrangements is pretty extensive, so please do discuss this throughout the process.

Software Engineer interview process
We do an initial competency interview which consists of some screening questions, like checking your right to work in the UK (unfortunately we can’t sponsor visas), and your experience in our hiring competencies.

This first interview has two purposes: it's a chance for you to ask questions about how we work, and for us to find out what you're looking for from your next role.

We'll also be interested to find out more about your curiosity, initiative, technical, communication and teamwork skills. So we'll be interested to talk about things like: your approach to dealing with difficult situations like dealing with conflicting or ambiguous requirements, how you communicate your work with others and how you learn new things and teach others.

The final stage interview consists of a half-day of interviews, where you’ll do a conversational technical interview and a pairing session with one of our engineers. You don’t need to prepare anything & there’s no take-home portion of the interview process.

How we assess candidates
We use a set of competencies to evaluate candidates throughout the interview process: communication, initiative, teamwork, curiosity and technical skill. You can read more about these in our blog post about our hiring framework.

What about the COVID-19 pandemic?

Since our software enables remote work, we've been essential in keeping construction sites operating safely during the crisis - which is why we need engineers like you more than ever! Most of Disperse is currently working from home and we expect this to last for the rest of the year.

We're leveraging game-changing tech to help us on our mission as the financial industry's leading source of AI-driven financial crime risk data and detection technology.

No fight against crime is complete without the right values, and we take ours very seriously!

CORONAVIRUS UPDATE: Hiring at Made Tech continues as usual. Our team are now all working remotely so all interviews will be facilitated remotely too. Hopefully, this will still be a good experience for candidates. (feedback welcome)
We're even set up to onboard any new starters remotely should we need to. All our projects are set up to continue remotely as well :)

---------------------------

Salary range is £71-90k per annum plus a range of excellent benefits. Apply below.

Our Lead Engineers lead teams to deliver digital, data and technology outcomes that improve society. They do this by establishing and leading teams to deliver software in public sector organisations.

What does the job entail?

We primarily write and deliver custom software for the public sector. We work across central and local government, as well as in health, and our past lies in the technology startup world. Technical excellence for us isn’t about delivering to feature lists. We place a strong emphasis on outcome-based delivery; ensuring our customer’s goals are understood and achieved with the technology we deploy.

Lead Software Engineers combine technical excellence, drive to deliver, and coaching, to achieve outcomes for our customers and their users, and to establish strong engineering cultures within our customer's organisations. They find themselves working on a variety of different problems from monoliths to microservices, upskilling colleagues and customers, always finding themselves learning from others, while constantly striving to be nice humans :)

Depending on our customers' needs our Lead Software Engineers may play one or more roles. Sometimes the role is very hands-on and you'll be the most senior engineer on the team delivering software, other times you will play more of a technical architect within a single team.

We need flexible individuals who enjoy a varied workload, are happy to switch between being more and less hands-on, but don't see themselves stepping away from code any time soon. It might be that you're stronger as a Tech Lead or as a Tech Architect, or only have experience in one area, that's okay as long as you have an interest and willingness to broaden your expertise.

Our teams have used Ruby with Rails and Sinatra, ES6 with React and Angular 2, C# with .NET Core. We don’t limit ourselves as a company and we expect all our Engineers to be keen on learning new technologies. Automation is important to our teams, so we make sure there is a CD pipeline set up to build, test, and release many times per day.

High performing software delivery teams need to be empowered to iteratively and rapidly deliver changes all the way through to production. To do this we combine our extensive cloud automation knowledge with DevOps culture.

We've been using AWS from the start and as Advanced Partners are go-to experts within the public sector. We use a range of IaaS, PaaS and FaaS depending on the needs of our users, in this case, software teams, such as EC2, Lambda, ECS, Kubernetes, Heroku, CloudFoundry, Azure App Services, and more. We use VPC and PrivateLink for connecting to on-premise, legacy systems. We also use API Gateway, S3, CloudFront, SQS, SNS, SES, RDS, and many other services provided by AWS.

We ensure we document our architecture and infrastructure as code, using technologies such as Terraform and OpenAPI. Containerisation is a big part of empowering our teams to develop, deploy and scale their applications, but so too is using AWS Lambda and avoiding the complexity of stateful services altogether. The right tool for the job.

For us, DevOps is about culture rather than roles and titles. Even though this role is for someone with strong DevOps experience, the biggest impact you will have is coaching and helping teams use the platforms you build. You won't be building infrastructure in isolation or charged with deploying other peoples work into production. You'll empower teams with the mantra: you build it, you run it!

We grow a team of polyglot programmers, which you might already consider yourself to be, who are versed in a mix of paradigms such as object-oriented, functional, declarative, event-based and aspect-oriented. To create this environment our Senior Engineers need to embrace sharing their knowledge and skills with others, and they need to keep an open mind – we’d love to hear some examples of mentoring, coaching and growing team members. Maybe you will have written some blog posts about your discipline, or perhaps even delivered a talk or two.

Requirements

What experience are we looking for?

While we will look for you to have experience in these things, if you don’t have one of these don’t let that stop you applying.

DueDil provides real-time insights on every company, helping financial services providers to give small businesses the products they need to thrive.

In the last three years, DueDil has grown rapidly in the UK and Ireland and we're now expanding into mainland Europe. We have over 400 clients across the Financial Services, Insurance and Fintech sectors, including Santander, Tide and Metro Bank.

This will mean dealing with challenges such as order of magnitude increase in data volumes, assessing quality of data from multiple suppliers and building pipelines and services using modern cloud tools to match and extract valuable insight from these datasets. We value DevOps culture so you will take full ownership of your solutions from prototyping all the way to production, and you'll do that working in a team of experienced Software Engineers and Data Scientists building next generation tools and transforming the Fintech industry.

At Anaplan these words come to life by making employees feel empowered and inspired.

Building a strong culture around company values is an ongoing journey

that will continue to be the core of our existence.

At Anaplan, we are looking for a self-motivated Software Engineer to join our growing team of global engineers at our vibrant tech hub in Kings Cross London, UK to build and ship award-winning, cloud planning technology that is helping people and companies around the world every day to make better-informed plans and decisions.

Anaplan are looking for a Software Engineer to join a cross-functional team of engineers delivering tools, platforms and SDKs for use within the organisation. Not only do we have a tight-knit and friendly team in a company with a great culture, but we have customers we can actually chat to daily. Few teams get to work as closely with their customers: ours are other Anaplan engineers.

You are a great software engineer who cares about writing code you're proud of, loves working as part of a team, with collaboration skills to match your engineering skills. You understand the principles that make Agile teams work and are not dogmatically tied to a fixed methodology.

Anaplan are serious about building a best-in-class platform for delivering software into modern environments built on Cloud Services, Kubernetes and Docker. So serious, in fact, that we've built a whole group within R&D dedicated to building the platform, handling delivery from code to production services with a DevOps mindset. We are a Developer Experience team in this group, which means we have a specific focus on delivering the tooling that engineers interact with every day.

If you love building your own software development tools, why not come and do it for a living?

We are a team of individuals who embrace and respect diverse perspectives, aren't afraid to push boundaries and try new ideas, and are passionate about helping our customers and each other succeed. We work hard, but we also don't wait for an excuse to have fun. In fact, we're so serious about it that it's one of our core values.

Located in a stunning, modern building overlooking the Regent's Canal, our London office is set in the beautiful Kings Place. A roof-top terrace, wrap around windows and within walking distance to plenty of great food options, you are set up not only to do great work but be in an environment that is inspiring.

What you'll be doing:
Writing quality, tested code, naturally
Writing, refining, estimating and validating stories
Conducting code reviews
Coaching junior members of the team
Contributing to the continuous improvement of the team's process and practices
Problem-solving issues in production systems
More about you:

You recognise the value in delivering value quickly and iterating. You are smart but recognise that you can learn from everyone around you, no matter how junior. You are a willing mentor. You take pride in the success of the team. You are unafraid give and receive feedback openly and with intention of improving yourself and helping those around you.

DueDil provides real-time insights on every company, helping financial services providers to give small businesses the products they need to thrive.

Reliance on manual checks makes it harder for SMEs to open an account, take out a loan or get insurance cover. It also makes it harder for the companies providing those products to carry out ongoing Know Your Business checks.

DueDil's KYB for Life platform transforms how providers work with SMEs. We analyse billions of data points on millions of companies to provide unique insights via our API.

In the last three years, DueDil has grown rapidly in the UK and Ireland and we're now expanding into mainland Europe. We have over 400 clients across the Financial Services, Insurance and Fintech sectors, including Santander, Tide and Metro Bank.
