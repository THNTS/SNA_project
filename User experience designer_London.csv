We've taken something complicated and made it simple, so that sending money is as easy as sending a text message Tap the WorldRemit app or head to on our website, and your international transfer is made – to a bank account, cash pickup, Mobile Money, or airtime top-up. Founded in 2010, we send international remittances from 50 countries to more than 150 countries and we continue to expand our footprint.

Using WorldRemit is easy because we do the hard part, connecting hundreds of banks, money agents, mobile operators and payment systems around the world. These were never designed to work together, but WorldRemit makes it happen.

WorldRemit has grown - on average - by 50% year on year and is now processing over £3.1bn of remittances on an annualised basis. WorldRemit's success, and the size of the market it is operating in, means it has attracted investment from the world's leading technology and impact investors, Accel, Technology Crossover Ventures (TCV) and Leapfrog with $370m invested to date. We currently employ close to 1,000 employees and have offices in London, USA, Philippines, Poland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, Hong Kong and other locations.

The journey is just beginning. We believe in faster, simpler, more accessible money transfers. That means building better products and services for our customers.

Changing the world isn't easy – so we only hire the most talented people. You need to think differently, believe in new solutions to old problems, and have the drive to make them happen. We aim to attract, retain and develop people that can bring to life our values:
Aim high - We dream big, think bold and go the extra mile
Embrace challenge - We ask questions, start conversations, and always love to learn
Do what's right - We act with integrity, building trust in ourselves and in our business

21,User experience designer,London,UX Designer,-1,"Hi There! This is probably not the first job description you’ve seen so we’ve done our best to stand out while also accurately presenting what we’re all about. If it sounds like you’d enjoy working with us, don’t hesitate to apply.
What’s a Silverfin?
At Silverfin we’re trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS we’re automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimize their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners.
The good news is we’re succeeding in doing exactly that. Every day more than 15,000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 200,000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is there’s still plenty left to work on, and that’s where we hope you come in.
What’s special about working at Silverfin?
We’re a growing cross-functional remote-first team which is distributed across 14 different countries. A priority for us is maintaining a proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than they’ve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring in this regard, and we feel that’s exactly how it should be.
Working with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. It’s OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids — whatever reason, you don’t need to explain yourself.

That sounds great but what will you be doing?
You’ll be joining a growing Product team as our first UX designer
You’ll be creating experiences for a range of users, like accountants around the world, finding simple solutions for complex user experience challenges
You’ll develop ways of working that encourage and enable the product team - and the wider business - to put the experience of the end user first, be they accountants, their clients or external contributors to Silverfin’s marketplace
You’ll help define the user experience design of a complex set of products, while pulling them together to deliver a coherent Silverfin experience
You’ll use your skills in UX, interaction design and basic coding or prototyping to quickly solve problems and to conceptualise new ideas for teams across the business
You’ll be involved in a variety of projects, ensuring the integrity of design and UX and championing user-centred design principles

A bit more about you
You have a passion for understanding real people’s real problems, and developing ideas and solutions based on insight
You recognise assumptions (including your own) and seek ways to validate them
You have a toolbox of methods and techniques for visualising problems, user journeys, and interactions, as well as for developing and testing solutions
You’re an empathetic team player, especially when you’re communicating research findings, explaining the rationale behind a design or challenging ways of working
You’re experienced working in a cross-functional agile environment or a startup
You know your strengths and recognise there’s always more to learn
You can communicate clearly in English, both written and verbally

What can we offer you?
Actual, proper work-life balance
Choose your own working hours, working from one of our offices in Ghent or London, or work 100% remotely
Personal growth training and opportunities
Join a distributed remote-first engineering team with colleagues in different countries
A refreshing work environment with professional, friendly and welcoming colleagues

You have at least 4 years of experience working in design, of which 2+ years have been as a UX designer

24,User experience designer,London,Product Designer,-1,"We’re looking for Product Designers to lead design in teams working on our core personal and business banking products. Whichever team you join, the impact and remit of this role is huge.

The Monzo current account is a daily part of life for more than 4 million people already, and your work here will shape the way that people interact with their finances in brand new ways.

Our business bank account is an earlier-stage product that was launched just this spring across Android, iOS and web. We now have a highly engaged and fast-growing user base of businesses, and we're building and iterating rapidly.

We care deeply about inclusive working practices and diverse teams. We’re keen to ensure we’re designing a bank that works for everyone, so we particularly encourage applications from different underrepresented demographics.

What you’ll do everyday
You’ll lead design for a product area. This includes driving the future vision of this area, making sure it compliments a cohesive overall Monzo experience, and delivering on incremental steps to help the team head in this direction.
You’ll be embedded in a cross-functional product squad. You’ll be responsible for all design artefacts produced; from initial discovery and user journey mapping through to the execution of final UI design details.
You’ll deeply understand the customers you’re designing for. Whether it’s joining user research sessions, learning from previous insights, reading data reports or running your own lightweight research and analysis, you’ll strive to understand the what, why and how of the problems you’re solving for to ensure we don’t just ship the thing right, but we ship the right thing.
You’ll collaborate regularly using strong communication, documentation and facilitation skills. You’ll work closely with PMs, Engineers, Data scientists, User researchers and Writers to make sure your team isn’t just shipping great designs, but they are deeply involved throughout the design process.
You’ll execute (and advocate for) polished, intuitive and accessible user experiences. You’re pragmatic and able to balance the ideal experience with knowing where and when to make scoping trade-offs based on technical constraints, experimentation strategy or business risk.
You’ll help raise the bar for design at Monzo. We’re a small but mighty team where every designer plays a critical role in improving our community of practice—whether that’s through improving our craft skills to leading rituals to giving great feedback.
You’ll regularly work with a design director and product leadership. This is to help make sure long-term strategy, business goals and experience quality are all in alignment and that there are healthy opportunities for visibility and feedback.
Projects you could work on
Our core banking features such as budgeting for Monzo's iPhone and Android apps. Visibility and control of money across multiple accounts: we want Monzo to be the financial hub of your life, and something this ambitious requires a lot of good design.
Taking our new Monzo Plus account to the next level and creating valuable and desirable new premium features for our customers.
Core features for our new business banking apps across Android, iOS and web. More on our transparent roadmap for business accounts.
You should apply if
You’ve led the design of world-class product launches in a fast-growing company before.
You understand that good design is not about trends but is built on top of principles and tradeoffs. You make well-reasoned design decisions always advocating for the best possible user experience.
You’re passionate about inclusive design and accessibility, and you’ll design with all our users in mind.
You care about the UI design details but are also comfortable zooming out, seeing the broader picture and connecting the dots to create a cohesive overall experience.
You’re passionate about sharing your knowledge, and raising the bar for design practice at Monzo. Previous experience mentoring designers is a big plus.
You understand that writing is designing, you're a confident writer, and the copy in your screens is never an afterthought.
This isn’t for you if
You’ve not worked as part of an in-house product development team to launch a consumer-facing product or feature before. We know there are many great designers in agencies and consultancies, but due to the seniority of this role, we require strong experience embedded as a key member of a product development team.
You want to focus on people management. While mentoring other designers and levelling up the team is an expectation at this level, the initial scope of the role will focus on being an individual contributor. Things change quickly at Monzo though so there could be future people management opportunities if you’re interested in this path.
You need top-down direction. We operate extremely autonomously so you’ll be expected to determine the highest impact areas to work on, collaborating with your product squad and manager to ensure there’s alignment here.
Salary and location particulars
We explain salary bands as part of our initial calls. We want to be able to have a dialogue with candidates about what we pay and why, and answer any questions they have in the moment. See more details on our benefits package here.

Mission Statement
Can you look past “best practices” of product, UX, and interaction as they’ve been defined for computing so far? We aren’t looking for somebody to make mobile style minimalism, or port the VR flavor of the week. We need designers that are willing to break down the tropes of computing and transfer them to a new medium, mixed reality on spatial computers. We don’t want novel or just different, but rather, a return to human centric design that has traditionally only been seen in physical products. Are you ready to bring your tools but also to question them?
HoloMeeting is looking for a Product Experience Designer, assisting in the research, strategy, and visual articulation of spatial computing solutions and user experiences. Living at the intersection of a user experience designer, industrial designer, and concept artists, this role assists in converting user insights into visual narratives and other design artifacts that facilitate both conceptual understanding and feature decomposition by implementation teams. HoloMeeting is a dynamic company: successful candidates can expect to interpret market and user trends, feature definition and prioritization, to quickly visualize functional and emotional experiences.
Responsibilities
Inspire a broad swath of engineers, designers, artists, executives, and program managers with approachable explanations of experiences, applications, and product concepts.
Utilize a design thinking methodology to discover key user insights that will guide product development.
Work directly with Sales and Business Development teams to uncover market insights that can directly influence the discovery and ideation of new platform solutions.
Work directly with Brand Experience teams to incorporate attributes of spatial computing into brand language and other activations.
Produce high-level visual representations of user experiences and user journeys across a wide variety of consumer and enterprise use cases that highlight the attributes of spatial computing.
Document best practices for articulating complex spatial computing use cases and user experiences with hand gesture and 6DoF control interaction.
Adapt key platform features of spatial computing into high-value use cases for enterprises and consumers.
Qualifications
4 years in a professional Design role; 2 years in a Design role focused on Spatial Computing platform is desirable
Bachelor degree in Design or related fields is required for this position
Proven ability to deliver complex work products with minimal oversight
Proven ability to be a dynamic visual thinker, quickly computing initial ideas and concepts visually
Proven ability to work across different styles, programs, and mediums, from rough hand sketches to high fidelity digital renderings
Proven ability to think strategically and visualize complex systems
Proven expertise in understanding and applying key attributes of spatial computing to various use cases.
Proven expertise in the development of user experiences and interfaces that are based off a combination of a unique combination of input modes( 6DoF control, Hand gesture, Eye
Gaze) and perception constructs (Spatial Anchors, Lightfields)

About Us:

We are on a mission to become the world's most entertaining online gaming company. It all started with Jackpotjoy but along the way we have grown into the award-winning team of designers, developers and operators behind some of the leading gaming sites and apps including Virgin Games and Heart Bingo.

Born in 2001 with just a handful of developers, we are now over 1300 employees with our headquarters in Central London.

Whether it be through the awards we've won for innovation in Bingo and Slots, our commitment to using cutting edge technology, or simply our passion to innovate, thrill, and surprise, Gamesys constantly pushes the boundaries to be the best in class.

Our culture is visible everywhere. Visit our reception - you'll find sweets and a giant monkey, in the design team a giant red lamp and the latest quad core mac pros; the breakout areas a Gamesys pool table and fridges full of beer, wine and soft drinks. In the meeting rooms you might find grass instead of carpet, in the summer you'll meet all our families together for a celebration and in the winter you can find Mexican wrestlers or circus acts roaming around. Weekly social and sports events give you the opportunity to stretch both your mind and body, whether it be getting involved in a meetup or brownbag session, playing in the poker tournament or joining one of the many sports teams. But our culture is not just in what you can see it's in everything we do, we're hard workers and we get stuck in. We have fun, making fun and our vision is to invent, play and discover together, to craft experiences that thrill our players and rock the world.",3.6,"Gamesys

51,User experience designer,London,Product Designer,-1,"What is Stairway?


At Stairway, we make learning STEM fun and effective. We do this for two reasons.

First, we believe that to create a generation of people able to solve the major challenges in the world, we need to inspire students to want to solve them. This begins by inspiring them to enjoy learning STEM, and motivating them to continue learning for the rest of their lives. Schools still focus on teaching kids to pass exams, and they lose interest. We want to change that, and help students discover their passion in STEM subjects.

Second, we want to make high-quality education available to students of all backgrounds. Educational opportunity is not evenly distributed, and this isn't fair. All students need access to great education to give them the best chances in life, and societies need access to the best possible scientists and technologists. We believe that technology will be an equalising force, by providing students all over the world with effective, engaging and personalised education at an affordable price.

Why Stairway?


Education has the power to fix almost every other problem in the world. It's the foundation of your life, and deeply influences the choices you make and the opportunities available to you. Many people around the world don't have the luxury of great education, so their choices and opportunities are inherently limited.

What would happen if every single child around the world had access to the same level of education as one of London's top performing schools? What would happen if all students dreamt of becoming scientists, engineers, makers and builders? We are interested in answering these questions.

Who are we looking for?


We're looking for someone who wants to make an impact. Education remains relatively untouched by technology. In fact, we still learn in broadly the same way as we did 100 years ago.

We're looking for a Product Designer to take on the challenge of designing a new way to learn, and bring that experience to students across the world; many of whom would otherwise not have access. We're looking for someone who thrives on meaningful work, and is willing to take a long-term view of how we can change an industry.

We’re building a future where access to high quality learning is stress-free for those who can afford it, and funded for those who can't.

One-to-one tuition is one of the most powerful interventions to improve pupils’ grades, confidence and life chances. Yet it remains out of reach for many. Our handpicked network of tutors work online with pupils from all walks of life, and our tutors have given half a million lessons so far – raising results on average by one whole grade. We’re proud of the fact that over 550 schools have also chosen to work with us. And that we’ve earned a TrustPilot rating of 4.8/5.

We understand the hectic lives of families with teenagers, and our flexible lesson times mean parents can juggle schedules more easily. It's simple to find a tutor each child gets on with – and every lesson is tailored to their needs. And with online not only is it safe given the current environment, but families also have access to the best tutors no matter where they live or when they need help.

You’ll draw on the experience of the wider team. You might run workshops, sketching sessions, or ask a team member for feedback on your work.

You've already started your career

We're looking for someone who has at least 1-2 years experience working as part of a design team, either in house at a company or startup or at a design agency.

55,User experience designer,London,Product Designer,-1,"We’re currently hiring Midweight Product Designers to join our team in London.
Idean is a global design studio, operating in the realms of design, technology and business. At about 90 here in London, we’re a curious and caring mix of thinkers, makers and doers. We believe that companies need to transform their business of today while building their business of tomorrow. We create products, services and Beta Businesses from scratch as well as transforming things that already exist from the ground up. Idean is a part of Capgemini Invent, and some of our projects are joint efforts with our extended family and some are Idean solo teams.
Idean is a place where you can make real change at a truly enormous scale. We work with some of the biggest and most-exciting businesses across all sorts of industries – so if you care about impact, this is a place where you can make it. We’re helping clients launch Beta Businesses and challenging existing setups in Telco, Energy, Financial Services and Retail, amongst other sectors. One of these new businesses, SMARTY, recently became the best-rated mobile network on Trustpilot. Not bad for a baby business. Our team has written a bunch of articles about their work and life here at Idean over on our blog.
We take on projects of many shapes and sizes. They can be short or long, depending on the scope. And they can sometimes involve some travel to see clients and users. However right now, like most companies around the world, we’re embracing remote working. Our studio has slowly started to re-open for those who'd like to spend time there (all optional of course) but our later plan is to develop a hybrid model, where some purposeful in-person working will sit alongside continued remote working. This means that to work at Idean UK your fixed place of residence must be in or around London (although we appreciate you might be elsewhere right now).
More about the role
You’ll be responsible for delivering against our multidisciplinary approach to designing and launching products, services and businesses - some of the bravest projects our clients have ever launched. You’ll also be a part of advancing our approach, helping to grow our culture, and partnering with and inspiring our clients.

Our design team is an incredibly talented bunch of hybrids and this is something we embrace. The team consists of people with a background in research, UX, UI, visual design, and brand. We know that unicorns don’t exist but we do like hybrid designers who span multiple areas of product design, often with particular strength in one or two of these areas, and especially those who have been a part of teams who have launched products to market, or who have worked on products in-market. We’re flexible about what your experience is and appreciate that at this level you will still be exploring and building up your core set of skills.
You can
Support the delivery of complex service and product design projects
Work within multi-disciplinary teams to design, prototype and build cutting-edge propositions and products
Deliver quality design work and inspire the client towards these standards
Facilitate experiments and design sprints
Contribute to advancing Idean’s design approach
Collaborate with clients to successfully influence long-lasting change
Take an active interest in our product design Community of Practice and industry and regularly share your work and ideas with the broader team and community.
More about this level
As a midweight at Idean you are given the space to learn and explore different areas of expertise while contributing to the success of a team and project. This is typically a time when you have an emerging set of practice skills and we want you to explore these. You will play a hands-on role in the delivery of project activities and deliverables, e.g. workshops, presentations and feedback sessions, and your outputs will also include high quality work for your given practice with support and guidance from more senior practitioners. Throughout this you will build strong working relationships with clients and your teams, and we would want you to contribute to creating a supportive, caring and fun team environment and culture. You will identify ways to work on your personal development and actively participate in your Community of Practice and efforts across the studio.
You have
Experience of getting involved in multiple stages of the product and service design process, from initial analysis, workshops, sketches, ideas and concepts through to user research, prototyping and the final delivery of designs
Some experience of facilitating workshops, design sprints and ideation sessions
Ideally some experience of taking a product to market by working closely with developers and optimising the performance of that product over time through testing and iteration
A combination of experience across designing for mobile and web user-focused applications, as well as denser, information-rich interfaces
A focus on process and proof. Testing and iterating must be an inherent part of your approach
Information architecture, prototyping, personas and storytelling, behavioural economics, and/or ethnographic research experience would be nice to have
The drive to deliver great work
A natural curiosity to learn from those around you and to seek out opportunities
The instinct to ask regular questions and approach your team to discuss challenges along the way
Comfort participating in sessions with clients
Buckets of positivity and a “can do” attitude.
Don’t worry about being a 100% fit. That’s impossible nonsense, anyway. If this sounds like an interesting opportunity to you, and you think it could work, let’s chat.
What to expect from our application process
Standard stuff, really. First, we'll take a look at your application and you’ll hear from us within a couple of weeks. If you look like a possible fit for the role, then we’ll invite you to have a remote chat with someone from our Talent team. After that, there will be two remote interviews with people from the team you’re applying to, perhaps with a task (depending on the role you’re applying for). There are no robots screening CVs here, so we apologise if it takes a little longer than expected.
We offer
A challenging, creative and supportive working environment is important to us. We’ve put a lot of thought into how we work, and how we grow and support our team. Our policies on inclusive behaviours, mental health and parental responsibilities, and more, are designed to work for our people. While we strive to be as inclusive and forward-thinking as humanly possible, we also know we can always do better. The point is, we’re keen to talk about and accommodate any need that helps you get good work done while enjoying a quality work-life balance.

Conversion is the largest dedicated conversion rate optimisation (CRO) and testing agency in the UK. We help our clients better understand their customers - and translate this insight into action. As a business, our focus is on helping clients create an unfair competitive advantage through testing.

We believe that testing is not about changing button colours, but about creating a testing framework that allows our clients to take calculated risks. This approach allows us to test not only our clients’ websites and apps, but also their pricing, product, and strategy. The nature of testing means that we can definitively demonstrate and deliver ROI for our clients.

Our team is made up of a number of specialists and generalists with skills spanning: copywriting, behavioral psychology, user research, analytics, UX design, frontend development, and project management.

We’ve delivered results for clients ranging from one-person lead generation sites to the likes of Canon, Dominos, and UNICEF.

We have grown significantly over the last few years and are investing in the next stage of our growth to help us achieve our goal to help our clients start testing everywhere.

ABOUT THE ROLE

You will be a key player in one of our 4 pods consisting of a Consultant, an Associate Consultant, a Developer, a Project Manager, a QA engineer, and you, the Designer.

You will work closely with the consultants to understand the user insights they have gathered and the conversion optimisation strategy they have created for each client. You’ll use these findings to form A/B test executions that you feel will best answer the experiment hypotheses. You will be responsible for creating wireframes and designs and pitching those ideas to both the consultant and the client.

Along the way, you will learn all about CRO and develop an experimentation mindset that will help set you apart from other designers.

Were looking for a Senior level UX Designer. Not a UX/UI Designer or a Product Designer, but a pure UX Designer whos weathered the battles in bureaucracies that never truly believe the customer is right. Theyve tuned their thinking to take a critical eye to briefs and initiatives, unafraid to question them and debate to ensure the right problems are addressed.

Were looking for someone who can work a UX process blindfolded and wont just follow the same steps every time. Theyll analyse the problem and the requirements and with customer-centricity in their DNA, theyll use relevant UX methods to ensure that insights come from users before they design outcomes that they know will have impact. (If youre ticking industry buzzwords, theres at least five there.)

Avast sprang from humble beginnings in the late 80s with an anti-bureaucratic, punk culture and liked to move fast. Weve grown a lot since then and admittedly, signs of a big corporate culture have started to creep in. But our new CEO, who began as an engineering intern 20 years ago, is on a mission to rediscover our roots and move to be nimble, purposeful and aligned, with highly autonomous teams delivering great outcomes for our customers.

Our four core values are: Customer Comes First, No BS, Think Big and Give back. Were on the path to living by these values, delighting our customers, solving big challenges together and ultimately making our people proud to work at Avast!

Were looking to fill an influential role in a new UXD team, to work on and guide the UX across products. Were 6 people now, made up of UX Designers, Product Designers and User Researchers but as the team steadily grows (doubling by 2022), others will look to you for leadership. Theres no bureaucracy, only goal-driven autonomy, and youll have the freedom to work within the wider CCleaner business unit that really does believe in customer centricity. Youll focus on interesting and challenging UX problems to evolve our apps as they are now (as well as new Privacy products) to best-in-class products of the future that help and protect people. An ethical cause for sure, but youll also help to turn a technology brand, well-known for its security and optimisation excellence, into a market leader for good design and user experiences. And youll do this in a sustainable way, collaborating within a team where work-life balance, as well as having fun, is a priority.

If youre driven, proactive, keen to keep learning, and love the idea of being instrumental in a high performing team, but most of all, a nice person, then youll fit right in. Were growing, weve got grand plans and have just had our best ever financial quarter. If all the above sounds good and sounds like you, then theres no better time to join us!

About Us:

We are on a mission to become the world's most entertaining online gaming company.

Born in 2001 with just a handful of developers, we are now over 1300 employees with our headquarters in Central London.

Our culture is visible everywhere. Visit our reception - you'll find sweets and a giant monkey, in the design team a giant red lamp and the latest quad core mac pros; the breakout areas a Gamesys pool table and fridges full of beer, wine and soft drinks. In the meeting rooms you might find grass instead of carpet, in the summer you'll meet all our families together for a celebration and in the winter you can find Mexican wrestlers or circus acts roaming around. Weekly social and sports events give you the opportunity to stretch both your mind and body, whether it be getting involved in a meetup or brownbag session, playing in the poker tournament or joining one of the many sports teams. But our culture is not just in what you can see it's in everything we do, we're hard workers and we get stuck in.

75,User experience designer,London,Product Designer,-1,"We’re currently hiring Midweight Product Designers to join our team in London.
Idean is a global design studio, operating in the realms of design, technology and business. At about 90 here in London, we’re a curious and caring mix of thinkers, makers and doers. We believe that companies need to transform their business of today while building their business of tomorrow. We create products, services and Beta Businesses from scratch as well as transforming things that already exist from the ground up. Idean is a part of Capgemini Invent, and some of our projects are joint efforts with our extended family and some are Idean solo teams.
Idean is a place where you can make real change at a truly enormous scale. We work with some of the biggest and most-exciting businesses across all sorts of industries – so if you care about impact, this is a place where you can make it. We’re helping clients launch Beta Businesses and challenging existing setups in Telco, Energy, Financial Services and Retail, amongst other sectors. One of these new businesses, SMARTY, recently became the best-rated mobile network on Trustpilot. Not bad for a baby business. Our team has written a bunch of articles about their work and life here at Idean over on our blog.
We take on projects of many shapes and sizes. They can be short or long, depending on the scope. And they can sometimes involve some travel to see clients and users. However right now, like most companies around the world, we’re embracing remote working. Our studio has slowly started to re-open for those who'd like to spend time there (all optional of course) but our later plan is to develop a hybrid model, where some purposeful in-person working will sit alongside continued remote working. This means that to work at Idean UK your fixed place of residence must be in or around London (although we appreciate you might be elsewhere right now).
More about the role
You’ll be responsible for delivering against our multidisciplinary approach to designing and launching products, services and businesses - some of the bravest projects our clients have ever launched. You’ll also be a part of advancing our approach, helping to grow our culture, and partnering with and inspiring our clients.

Our design team is an incredibly talented bunch of hybrids and this is something we embrace. The team consists of people with a background in research, UX, UI, visual design, and brand. We know that unicorns don’t exist but we do like hybrid designers who span multiple areas of product design, often with particular strength in one or two of these areas, and especially those who have been a part of teams who have launched products to market, or who have worked on products in-market. We’re flexible about what your experience is and appreciate that at this level you will still be exploring and building up your core set of skills.
You can
Support the delivery of complex service and product design projects
Work within multi-disciplinary teams to design, prototype and build cutting-edge propositions and products
Deliver quality design work and inspire the client towards these standards
Facilitate experiments and design sprints
Contribute to advancing Idean’s design approach
Collaborate with clients to successfully influence long-lasting change
Take an active interest in our product design Community of Practice and industry and regularly share your work and ideas with the broader team and community.
More about this level
As a midweight at Idean you are given the space to learn and explore different areas of expertise while contributing to the success of a team and project. This is typically a time when you have an emerging set of practice skills and we want you to explore these. You will play a hands-on role in the delivery of project activities and deliverables, e.g. workshops, presentations and feedback sessions, and your outputs will also include high quality work for your given practice with support and guidance from more senior practitioners. Throughout this you will build strong working relationships with clients and your teams, and we would want you to contribute to creating a supportive, caring and fun team environment and culture. You will identify ways to work on your personal development and actively participate in your Community of Practice and efforts across the studio.
You have
Experience of getting involved in multiple stages of the product and service design process, from initial analysis, workshops, sketches, ideas and concepts through to user research, prototyping and the final delivery of designs
Some experience of facilitating workshops, design sprints and ideation sessions
Ideally some experience of taking a product to market by working closely with developers and optimising the performance of that product over time through testing and iteration
A combination of experience across designing for mobile and web user-focused applications, as well as denser, information-rich interfaces
A focus on process and proof. Testing and iterating must be an inherent part of your approach
Information architecture, prototyping, personas and storytelling, behavioural economics, and/or ethnographic research experience would be nice to have
The drive to deliver great work
A natural curiosity to learn from those around you and to seek out opportunities
The instinct to ask regular questions and approach your team to discuss challenges along the way
Comfort participating in sessions with clients
Buckets of positivity and a “can do” attitude.
Don’t worry about being a 100% fit. That’s impossible nonsense, anyway. If this sounds like an interesting opportunity to you, and you think it could work, let’s chat.
What to expect from our application process
Standard stuff, really. First, we'll take a look at your application and you’ll hear from us within a couple of weeks. If you look like a possible fit for the role, then we’ll invite you to have a remote chat with someone from our Talent team. After that, there will be two remote interviews with people from the team you’re applying to, perhaps with a task (depending on the role you’re applying for). There are no robots screening CVs here, so we apologise if it takes a little longer than expected.
We offer
A challenging, creative and supportive working environment is important to us. We’ve put a lot of thought into how we work, and how we grow and support our team. Our policies on inclusive behaviours, mental health and parental responsibilities, and more, are designed to work for our people. While we strive to be as inclusive and forward-thinking as humanly possible, we also know we can always do better. The point is, we’re keen to talk about and accommodate any need that helps you get good work done while enjoying a quality work-life balance.

76,User experience designer,London,Product Designer,-1,"What is Stairway?


At Stairway, we make learning STEM fun and effective. We do this for two reasons.

First, we believe that to create a generation of people able to solve the major challenges in the world, we need to inspire students to want to solve them. This begins by inspiring them to enjoy learning STEM, and motivating them to continue learning for the rest of their lives. Schools still focus on teaching kids to pass exams, and they lose interest. We want to change that, and help students discover their passion in STEM subjects.

Second, we want to make high-quality education available to students of all backgrounds. Educational opportunity is not evenly distributed, and this isn't fair. All students need access to great education to give them the best chances in life, and societies need access to the best possible scientists and technologists. We believe that technology will be an equalising force, by providing students all over the world with effective, engaging and personalised education at an affordable price.

Why Stairway?


Education has the power to fix almost every other problem in the world. It's the foundation of your life, and deeply influences the choices you make and the opportunities available to you. Many people around the world don't have the luxury of great education, so their choices and opportunities are inherently limited.

What would happen if every single child around the world had access to the same level of education as one of London's top performing schools? What would happen if all students dreamt of becoming scientists, engineers, makers and builders? We are interested in answering these questions.

Who are we looking for?


We're looking for someone who wants to make an impact. Education remains relatively untouched by technology. In fact, we still learn in broadly the same way as we did 100 years ago.

We're looking for a Product Designer to take on the challenge of designing a new way to learn, and bring that experience to students across the world; many of whom would otherwise not have access. We're looking for someone who thrives on meaningful work, and is willing to take a long-term view of how we can change an industry.

The role


You will:

- Lead UX and visual design in the development of new products and features

- Work with founders and wider product team to define the scope of products

- Work with the product team to quickly prototype ideas, and both collaborate internally and test externally to iterate on prototypes

- Take part in user research, to help identify problems, test assumptions and inspire solutions

- Work across many design tools at various levels of fidelity and interactivity

- Develop, expand and impose our design system

We'd love it if you could:

- Develop our brand identity, through illustration and character design

- Create delight through motion design

Requirements

You'll need:

- At least 3 years relevant design experience at a product-driven company in tech

- Strong skills across the design spectrum. In order: UX, interaction design, visual design.

- Systems thinking, and the ability to architect a shared design language of patterns and behaviour

You'll be a great fit if you:

- Are passionate about creating the best UX in education

- Want to take ownership of design for an early-stage product

- Love spending 90% of your time creating designs/prototypes and speaking to users

- Demonstrate a strong bias for action

- Constantly push yourself to make your work pixel-perfect, and believe that the smallest details make all the difference

- Empathise deeply with users' problems, and love using your design toolkit to solve these problems creatively

Benefits

- Stock Option Plan

- Training & Development Budget

- 25 days holiday per year

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

The Palantir Design Team is responsible for the human experience of using our software. Our team is growing rapidly, but we're committed to creating a tight-knit team environment that fosters trust, integrity, empathy, and growth. We work together in realizing a shared product vision, and regularly give feedback and critique to each other.

Designing at Palantir is a varied experience. On a given day, you might be: leading a design sprint for your product team; designing a micro-interaction to make a complex analytical task feel simple; and/or advocating for UX consistency by creating flexible, reusable UI components.

Core Responsibilities

• Interaction and visual design. As a product designer, you'll be involved at every stage of design work. You'll help define early product concepts, flesh out the high-level workflow and micro-interactions of a feature, and execute on a crisp and effective visual design. You should have experience with some of the following mockup and prototyping tools: Sketch, Framer, Principle, Figma, Invision.
• User research. We frequently do informal user research, and value people who can be flexible with research processes and methodologies to achieve the right outcome. You'll often visit customer offices to interview and learn from the users we serve. You'll pair qualitative methods (e.g. scripted usability tests and contextual inquiry) with quantitative information, like product and usage metrics.
• Prototyping. You will prototype—using software like Principle and Framer, or another favorite method—both to communicate your designs and validate your decisions.
• Partnering with engineers. We work closely with product and forward deployed engineers to realize our design ideas. You'll treat engineers as partners and collaborate with them to prototype and build out products.
• Awareness of how software interfaces are built. Familiarity with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Typescript is appreciated. You don't need to be an expert—just fluent enough to collaborate with engineers, and know what's possible with frontend technologies. Resources and mentorship are available to designers who want to learn more.

Designers at Palantir have great autonomy over their work, so a wide skill set is necessary. However, many designers on the team are also passionate experts in one area. You might be the kind of designer who ships code every week, or the kind of designer who shares detailed user research findings with your team.
What We Value
An iterative design process. You validate your ideas early (with stakeholders and users) and are thoughtful and intentional in seeking and responding to feedback. You move fast, listen, and adapt. You rapidly incorporate feedback, and prioritize collaboration. You are adept at giving and receiving critiques.
Collaboration and communication. You can build great relationships with engineers, PMs, and other stakeholders—and convey your design rationale to them. To reach these audiences, you'll communicate your designs through a variety of methods: presenting your mockups, making prototypes, sharing a design spec.
Thoughtful, intentional work. You know that form informs function and usability—that the surface layer doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Your design decisions are often informed by—and will influence—engineering and business considerations.
Dedication to the user. You'll design software that changes how people use data in government, commercial, and philanthropic contexts. You strive to understand our users—who can range from a manufacturing plant worker to a pharmaceutical researcher—and fight to empower them.
Our team has people from a variety of backgrounds—people who studied type design, computer science, psychology; people who joined Palantir right after university; and people who joined our team after switching industries. We value skills and mindset over a specific educational background.

One-to-one tuition is one of the most powerful interventions to improve pupils’ grades, confidence and life chances. Yet it remains out of reach for many. Our handpicked network of tutors work online with pupils from all walks of life, and our tutors have given half a million lessons so far – raising results on average by one whole grade. We’re proud of the fact that over 550 schools have also chosen to work with us. And that we’ve earned a TrustPilot rating of 4.8/5.

We understand the hectic lives of families with teenagers, and our flexible lesson times mean parents can juggle schedules more easily. It's simple to find a tutor each child gets on with – and every lesson is tailored to their needs. And with online not only is it safe given the current environment, but families also have access to the best tutors no matter where they live or when they need help.

About the role


We’re looking for a Product Designer to join our growing product-engineering team. You'll be responsible for talking to our users, running workshops and creating prototypes to help discover the best solutions.

It’s important that we understand our users needs and frustrations before we make decisions about our product. You’ll help conduct user interviews, surveys and run experiments on the site.

Help the business
You’ll understand how your designs contribute to business metrics and long term goals.

Bring others into your process
You’ll draw on the experience of the wider team. You might run workshops, sketching sessions, or ask a team member for feedback on your work.

Explore different concepts
Even if they don’t work out, you'll love exploring new interaction patterns or design concepts and bringing them into your designs.

Designing Interfaces
You’ll take your concepts and ideas through to final polished designs in Figma or Sketch and work with our development team to bring them to life.

Requirements

This role is for you if...

You have a passion for UI/ UX

You have can take an idea from start to finish
We want someone who has some knowledge of the product design process. Whether it’s through side projects, coursework, or some real experience we want to see a demonstration of how you approach designing digital products.

You enjoy working collaboratively
You’ll spend a lot of your time working closely with a product owner and the rest of the MyTutor business to collaboratively solve problems.

You've already started your career

We're looking for someone who has at least 1-2 years experience working as part of a design team, either in house at a company or startup or at a design agency.

You’re really interested in people
We have lots of diverse user types that we need to design for (teenagers, parents and students, teachers, operations staff to name a few) all with their own frustrations, needs and characteristics. A large part of this role will be making sure you intimately understand what they are going through and creating designs using this knowledge.

You have attention to detail and a view of the big picture
You’ll need to understand how your designs fit within the wider customer journey, but also love diving into the details of micro interactions, writing copy and design details.

You’ll be tasked with our most important challenge— improving the functionality and usability of our products to help democratise proven, powerful technology to benefit everyone.

We’re interested in talking to both mid and senior level designers— we care most about your skills, spirit and your ability to contribute.

Day to day, you’ll:
Craft new features, which are both beautiful and exceptionally fit for purpose, working directly with engineers, stakeholders and our user community.
Apply user-centric design. Enjoy the opportunity to iterate regularly. Make great products.
Illustrate design ideas with design comps, storyboards, user flows, wireframes and prototypes.
Communicate ideas effectively to the wider team, accepting critiques and feedback as part of the creative process.
Design things that scale by contributing to and using design systems (Figma), to help us move quickly and consistently across multiple platforms.
Conduct usability testing and gather feedback from our internal team and wide (and vocal!) community of users.

You have some front-end experience. We don’t expect you to write production quality code (you’ll work with people who are great at that!) but it helps if you can empathise with ease of implementation, and know the limitations of the web.

Now is a great time to join: We’re well funded and have rising revenues from a host of interesting customers— from The French Government and Mozilla to others we’re not allowed to talk about yet(!).
You’ll work on highly visible projects: Our early adopters are in the tens of millions and almost all of our work is open source and we receive regular feedback from our community of users. We’re figuring out how to best practise ‘open design’ in open source and you’ll be able to help shape that. We also speak regularly at conferences, meetups and talks.
You’ll be joining a small mission-led team with a supportive culture. In this role, you’ll work alongside talented Product Designers, Engineers & other senior stakeholders sharpening your skills.

About us
Totem keeps leaders and teams culturally connected, informed and engaged - even when working remotely. Designed for remote and/or dispersed teams, Totem helps colleagues stay in touch, feel connected and share their work experiences, wherever they are.
Our story began in 2014 when our parent company Play Consulting was formed. With a team of awesome game development legends, we set out to create playful experiences that realise human potential and meaning at work.
As Play grew we became more aware of the broken world of work. This got us thinking... how could we really change the way companies drive great culture at scale and help unlock the benefits for businesses and their people alike?
Seeing that most “work/ HR/ engagement” tools were built for payers (managers), we set about creating a beautiful app that would shift the focus to the players (employees) instead - that would help them connect with each other and their company, recognise and celebrate one another, and capture previously hidden insights about the company and team they work for. We called this app Totem.
Since launching in 2016, Totem has helped global companies drive better business outcomes through improved workplace cultures. And without setting out to, we created a new category of technology - Culture Tech. Technology that could enable CEOs to build great workplace culture from the ground up and make work more meaningful for everyone.

Create journey maps and blueprints
Bring the mastery of your craft
Design structures and flows as well as detailed interactions and stunning interfaces

Experience in product design for a B2B SaaS tech product
Examples/portfolio of your work that you can share, with the thinking about why a product is designed as it is
Confidence to work with key stakeholders
Ability to mock up a beautiful page with a design that actually works with real people and real-world constraints
Up to speed on Sketch and Marvel
Hunger to learn and experience with new tools, processes and techniques

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

The Palantir Design Team is responsible for the human experience of using our software. Our team is growing rapidly, but we're committed to creating a tight-knit team environment that fosters trust, integrity, empathy, and growth. We work together in realizing a shared product vision, and regularly give feedback and critique to each other.

Designing at Palantir is a varied experience. On a given day, you might be: leading a design sprint for your product team; designing a micro-interaction to make a complex analytical task feel simple; and/or advocating for UX consistency by creating flexible, reusable UI components.

Core Responsibilities

• Interaction and visual design. As a product designer, you'll be involved at every stage of design work. You'll help define early product concepts, flesh out the high-level workflow and micro-interactions of a feature, and execute on a crisp and effective visual design. You should have experience with some of the following mockup and prototyping tools: Sketch, Framer, Principle, Figma, Invision.
• User research. We frequently do informal user research, and value people who can be flexible with research processes and methodologies to achieve the right outcome. You'll often visit customer offices to interview and learn from the users we serve. You'll pair qualitative methods (e.g. scripted usability tests and contextual inquiry) with quantitative information, like product and usage metrics.
• Prototyping. You will prototype—using software like Principle and Framer, or another favorite method—both to communicate your designs and validate your decisions.
• Partnering with engineers. We work closely with product and forward deployed engineers to realize our design ideas. You'll treat engineers as partners and collaborate with them to prototype and build out products.
• Awareness of how software interfaces are built. Familiarity with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Typescript is appreciated. You don't need to be an expert—just fluent enough to collaborate with engineers, and know what's possible with frontend technologies. Resources and mentorship are available to designers who want to learn more.

Designers at Palantir have great autonomy over their work, so a wide skill set is necessary. However, many designers on the team are also passionate experts in one area. You might be the kind of designer who ships code every week, or the kind of designer who shares detailed user research findings with your team.
What We Value
An iterative design process. You validate your ideas early (with stakeholders and users) and are thoughtful and intentional in seeking and responding to feedback. You move fast, listen, and adapt. You rapidly incorporate feedback, and prioritize collaboration. You are adept at giving and receiving critiques.
Collaboration and communication. You can build great relationships with engineers, PMs, and other stakeholders—and convey your design rationale to them. To reach these audiences, you'll communicate your designs through a variety of methods: presenting your mockups, making prototypes, sharing a design spec.
Thoughtful, intentional work. You know that form informs function and usability—that the surface layer doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Your design decisions are often informed by—and will influence—engineering and business considerations.
Dedication to the user. You'll design software that changes how people use data in government, commercial, and philanthropic contexts. You strive to understand our users—who can range from a manufacturing plant worker to a pharmaceutical researcher—and fight to empower them.
Our team has people from a variety of backgrounds—people who studied type design, computer science, psychology; people who joined Palantir right after university; and people who joined our team after switching industries. We value skills and mindset over a specific educational background.

The company and our mission:

BridgeU was founded with the belief that talent is equally distributed across the globe, but opportunity is not. We take pride in helping students discover and explore the best pathways available to them - wherever those opportunities may be. We help universities to discover and attract the schools and students that will contribute to their vibrant, diverse and successful programs and courses.

In the fast-changing world of education, and in the ‘new normal’ in the wake of Covid-19, we believe BridgeU had never been more important to help students, schools and universities discover new opportunities globally and connect at a distance.

Today, BridgeU is the market leading provider of university and careers guidance software to international and globally-minded secondary schools. BridgeU is proud to work with secondary schools in over 300 cities across 119 countries. And, we partner with a quickly-growing number of leading universities, currently in 8 countries, to connect recruitment and admissions teams to the largest community of international schools available on one platform.

BridgeU has the approach and pace of a start-up, where there are always opportunities to try something new and grow, with, since early 2020, the support and stability of being part of Kaplan International, part of one of the world’s largest and most diverse education providers.

Who you’ll be working with:

Our teammates are talented people that come from a variety of backgrounds. We’re committed to building an inclusive culture based on trust and kindness, which creates a good work environment that helps enrich the product and support we provide to our customers.

This role could be office-based or fully remote, and could be based anywhere in either the UK or in Spain.

In normal times, we aim for team members to travel regularly between our offices to have face-to-face time with other team members to bond, work together and have some fun, and we’re aiming to get back to this in a post-Covid world as soon as feasible. In the meantime, we’ve been socialising, playing games, hosting quizzes, and other things, online so that we stay connected to one another.

175,User experience designer,London,Product Designer (Bristol or London),-1,"Started in 2017, Laka set out to transform insurance by connecting passionate cyclists all over the UK to form a collective and protect their bikes. A better model for insurance was born. For once people come first in insurance by fairly sharing the cost amongst each other.

Laka makes sure everything runs smoothly for the community: from exceptionally fast claims, to splitting the cost fairly, guaranteeing a maximum price and all the other heavy lifting of a regulated insurance business. For that service, the collective pays Laka a fee relative to the claims in a month.

For cyclists it's a simple calculation:
Together, take care of your gear, and reap the rewards of lower cost
Laka focuses on getting you back on your bike because that's how we get paid
It's a win-win all around!

We have grown 10x in 2019, receiving almost exclusively 5-star reviews by our members and backed by some of the most incredible investors on the planet. Besides our core bicycle insurance product, we have launched the Laka Club, challenging existing cycling memberships with a free offering for UK cyclists.

Cycling is at the core of everything we do and we have industry-shifting plans to establish a far bigger footprint for Laka than just insurance, and passionate cyclists in Europe and beyond.

You are the very first designer to join the company but you will be able to work from a strong brand platform developed with one of the leading agencies in London (but you can see for yourself). As the first designer, you will have a direct and meaningful impact to Laka. What you design ends is used by tens of thousands of incredible passionate cyclists and this is just the beginning.

You will work with peers from product, marketing, customer experience and engineering to ideate and deliver a beautiful and simple experience to our members.

We use Whimsical for wire framing and Figma for prototyping across our frontend and marketing teams but we are open to new tools and processes.

As Product Designer, you will own:
the visual identity of Laka across digital platforms (and if you'd like beyond)
the development and application of a scalable design system
the end-to-end design process including user research, ideation, prototyping and delivery
Requirements

To succeed in this role you will need to:
bring a strong understanding and practical experience of Interaction Design and Visual Design Systems for digital applications
design simple but exceptionally well thought through experiences for web and predominantly mobile users
understand how to leverage data to design better user experiences
bring empathy for our core users - passionate cyclists
Before you apply, please make sure that you have the permission to work in the UK (for exceptionally strong candidates we will consider to provide Visa sponsorship).

181,User experience designer,London,Product Designer (Bristol or London),-1,"Started in 2017, Laka set out to transform insurance by connecting passionate cyclists all over the UK to form a collective and protect their bikes. A better model for insurance was born. For once people come first in insurance by fairly sharing the cost amongst each other.

Laka makes sure everything runs smoothly for the community: from exceptionally fast claims, to splitting the cost fairly, guaranteeing a maximum price and all the other heavy lifting of a regulated insurance business. For that service, the collective pays Laka a fee relative to the claims in a month.

For cyclists it's a simple calculation:
Together, take care of your gear, and reap the rewards of lower cost
Laka focuses on getting you back on your bike because that's how we get paid
It's a win-win all around!

We have grown 10x in 2019, receiving almost exclusively 5-star reviews by our members and backed by some of the most incredible investors on the planet. Besides our core bicycle insurance product, we have launched the Laka Club, challenging existing cycling memberships with a free offering for UK cyclists.

Cycling is at the core of everything we do and we have industry-shifting plans to establish a far bigger footprint for Laka than just insurance, and passionate cyclists in Europe and beyond.

You are the very first designer to join the company but you will be able to work from a strong brand platform developed with one of the leading agencies in London (but you can see for yourself). As the first designer, you will have a direct and meaningful impact to Laka. What you design ends is used by tens of thousands of incredible passionate cyclists and this is just the beginning.

You will work with peers from product, marketing, customer experience and engineering to ideate and deliver a beautiful and simple experience to our members.

We use Whimsical for wire framing and Figma for prototyping across our frontend and marketing teams but we are open to new tools and processes.

As Product Designer, you will own:
the visual identity of Laka across digital platforms (and if you'd like beyond)
the development and application of a scalable design system
the end-to-end design process including user research, ideation, prototyping and delivery
Requirements

To succeed in this role you will need to:
bring a strong understanding and practical experience of Interaction Design and Visual Design Systems for digital applications
design simple but exceptionally well thought through experiences for web and predominantly mobile users
understand how to leverage data to design better user experiences
bring empathy for our core users - passionate cyclists
Before you apply, please make sure that you have the permission to work in the UK (for exceptionally strong candidates we will consider to provide Visa sponsorship).

Come join us!

At Splash Damage, we’re dedicated to crafting team-based multiplayer games that ignite friendships as much as they do healthy competition and teamwork.

Our teams celebrated the launch of Gears Tactics earlier this year, and we’re currently developing Outcasters for Stadia along with several unannounced titles.

As an UnrealEngine focused studio, we're excited to be transitioning our teams to the latest in UE5 technology and we're looking for skilled and passionate developers to help us drive this.

We're advocates for work-life balance and offer a comprehensive benefits package focused on the well-being of our staff and their families.

We believe that teams create the best work when they have a range of perspectives and experiences to draw from.

Therefore we're committed to increasing diversity across our studio, fostering an inclusive environment to ensure everyone's voices are heard.

Due to the on-going COVID-19 outbreak, we're all currently working from home. We’re still looking to welcome new team members, who'll join us remotely until we return to the studio.
Job Overview
UI Designers at Splash Damage turn complicated concepts and systems into intuitive and engaging experiences that enable players to interact with our game worlds and each other.
Applying user-centred design methodologies, UI Designers take ownership of UI features and drive them to completion. They create user flows, wireframes, interactive prototypes, and effectively apply colour theory and design principles to craft visual designs with a high degree of polish. After delivering mock-ups and design specs, they review the implementation to ensure it matches their vision, and use feedback from user testing to drive iteration as needed.
UI Designers are collaborative by nature and enjoy working with others to develop concepts and ideas. They see new challenges as opportunities to develop their own skills and are keen to keep honing their technical ability and expertise. UI Designers are selfless individuals who never lose sight of who they’re ultimately designing for – our players.
We believe that leveling up our skills is an essential part of the job and offer regular training opportunities and mentorship to all our UI designers.
You Have:
A solid background in UI design; you’ve worked on at least one commercial product for a significant period of its development and are comfortable working in Photoshop and Illustrator
Fluency in current design and typographical trends, with a keen eye for composition, clarity and usability
A can-do attitude and strong interpersonal skills; you love collaborating with others to craft solutions and can provide constructive feedback when asked
Solid time management and organisational skills; you can get the job done without close supervision
Good communication and presentation skills; you’re able to present ideas clearly and confidently both internally and to external partners
A real passion for UI and clear enthusiasm for games
Bonus Points for:
Prior game development experience
Experience with UI prototyping tools such as Adobe XD, Axure, Invision, or similar
Experience visualising UI animations in AfterEffects or Flash

Come join us!

At Splash Damage, we’re dedicated to crafting team-based multiplayer games that ignite friendships as much as they do healthy competition and teamwork.

Our teams celebrated the launch of Gears Tactics earlier this year, and we’re currently developing Outcasters for Stadia along with several unannounced titles.

As an UnrealEngine focused studio, we're excited to be transitioning our teams to the latest in UE5 technology and we're looking for skilled and passionate developers to help us drive this.

We're advocates for work-life balance and offer a comprehensive benefits package focused on the well-being of our staff and their families.

We believe that teams create the best work when they have a range of perspectives and experiences to draw from.

Therefore we're committed to increasing diversity across our studio, fostering an inclusive environment to ensure everyone's voices are heard.

Due to the on-going COVID-19 outbreak, we're all currently working from home. We’re still looking to welcome new team members, who'll join us remotely until we return to the studio.
Job Overview
UI Designers at Splash Damage turn complicated concepts and systems into intuitive and engaging experiences that enable players to interact with our game worlds and each other.
Applying user-centred design methodologies, UI Designers take ownership of UI features and drive them to completion. They create user flows, wireframes, interactive prototypes, and effectively apply colour theory and design principles to craft visual designs with a high degree of polish. After delivering mock-ups and design specs, they review the implementation to ensure it matches their vision, and use feedback from user testing to drive iteration as needed.
UI Designers are collaborative by nature and enjoy working with others to develop concepts and ideas. They see new challenges as opportunities to develop their own skills and are keen to keep honing their technical ability and expertise. UI Designers are selfless individuals who never lose sight of who they’re ultimately designing for – our players.
We believe that leveling up our skills is an essential part of the job and offer regular training opportunities and mentorship to all our UI designers.
You Have:
A solid background in UI design; you’ve worked on at least one commercial product for a significant period of its development and are comfortable working in Photoshop and Illustrator
Fluency in current design and typographical trends, with a keen eye for composition, clarity and usability
A can-do attitude and strong interpersonal skills; you love collaborating with others to craft solutions and can provide constructive feedback when asked
Solid time management and organisational skills; you can get the job done without close supervision
Good communication and presentation skills; you’re able to present ideas clearly and confidently both internally and to external partners
A real passion for UI and clear enthusiasm for games
Bonus Points for:
Prior game development experience
Experience with UI prototyping tools such as Adobe XD, Axure, Invision, or similar
Experience visualising UI animations in AfterEffects or Flash

227,User experience designer,London,UX / UI Designer,-1,"UX / UI designer to be part of founding team (5 people)
Peoplestack is looking to create an employee management system that solves the problems of HR, IT and payroll in onboarding and managing new employees. We want onboarding, which previously takes from half a day to multiple days of administration work, to take a few minutes. We want to provide a platform for HR to integrate multiple best-in-class point solutions to provide an overall superior experience of HR professionals and their employees.
Previous startups in this area have gone on to be worth well over a billion dollars, including Rippling and Gusto (US based) and Personio (Germany). We believe by taking a platform approach, it is possible to build an even better system that can scale much faster.
We are / We offer:
Pre-product, pre-revenue, pre-investment.
This opportunity is initially part time (12 hours per week) – we cannot offer a salary but do offer equity-based compensation for work.
Position will become full time after pre-seed investment (so we are looking for someone who is looking ultimately for a full time opportunity in the near future)
2 full time (Commercial co-founder, CTO), 2 part-time (Front-end, back-end engineers) currently working on the product.
We want the UX/UI designer to join the team to work on:
Primarily, working with two front-end engineers to design the user experience of PeopleStack, and create the initial components for the product (80-90% of time).
Secondarily, supporting CEO/CTO on creating marketing material (website and investment deck) (10-20% of time).
All members of our team must be willing to dedicate a minimum of 12 hours a week to this for the next 3 months as a minimum.
What we are looking for
We are looking for someone to join and be a true co-owner of the product. There are lots of ways to demonstrate this, but these are a few of the behaviours, background and attributes we value:
Must have a year or two as a minimum experience in designing web or mobile apps.
We want someone who is the type of customer-focused individual who will immediately go and speak to all their friends and ex-colleagues about what they do/don’t like about HR/Payroll software, and take our own views on the user with a healthy dose of skepticism and curiosity. You should also naturally be inclined to sign up for the free trials of similar products / competitors to understand the market without being prompted. If you can’t articulate why a certain design decision is better for the user, then we don’t think it’s a good one.
We don’t believe in copying the Zeitgeist. We want to design products where every aspect aids the solving of a particular problem and improves the functionality, not just the aesthetics, of the product. Because “X product” looks like this isn’t a good enough reason to do it a certain way.
You need to think about the interface between design and front-end engineering; every decision you make affects the front-end team. You should provide a theme and a set of components, and allow for interpretation downstream. Design engineering is not a “handover” in our view, there should be a tight iterative loop. History of previously developing some developer assets and contributing to the code base is a hugely positive signal.
If you see something that is obviously wrong with the product, you have the freedom to go and fix. There is an unlimited number of things related to the user experience of the product to work on, and we want someone who seeks impactful things to do, as opposed to waiting for topics to work on.
Our working style
We believe in talking about complexity early. The best way to talk about a great product is to spend an adequate amount of time discussing and getting everyone’s understanding of the product and the problem to the highest possible level. Obviously, there is a point of getting stuck in and learning by doing, but overall we bias towards debating and discussing more.
At this size, whilst we all occupy certain ‘roles’ in the business, we are also all joint owners and therefore welcome healthy debate about aspects that pertain to our roles. E.G the co-founders welcome input on overall company strategy. We expect the UX designer to be comfortable debating unemotionally but strongly about all aspects of the company strategy and the product – and not mind other people expressing informed opinions about “UX/UI”, as we feel everyone should ultimately bear some responsibility given it’s overall importance to the product. Every single decision you make as an engineer is really about the user and their experience too.
The way we work is questioning everything to try to figure out the truth, expecting pushback and ideas. You should be comfortable with receiving an extremely high level of comments and questions about your ideas and suggestions – these are of course all constructive, and we expect the same level of constructive feedback from all other members of the team. Ultimately, we believe in discussing and debating on the best way of doing things, and we will do so without ego or hierarchy.

Requirements

Does this sound like YOU?

We believe that a growth mindset, great skills and attitude and a killer worth ethic are just as -if not more important than -university degrees or decades spent in E-Commerce. We’re a high-performance, open, immediate and honest team, and we’re democratizing beauty, and changing the world. If you’re one of us, excited about the opportunity, and you’re really good at what you do (even if you don’t tick all the boxes) apply anyway!

We've figured out which kind of beauty products our members love, our financials are sustainable, and we’re about to take over the luxury beauty business (because we give our members a way bigger piece of the PIE). Our biggest opportunity to tackle will be in your hands!

You’ll learn. In fact, we’ll all learn, if we’re open-minded enough. After all, we’re a startup, and we’ll be growing for years to come.

But as long as we acknowledge and learn from the mistakes we make, and iterate and evolve, we’ll be winning.

It’s not very often you get an opportunity like this. To build a great product, from scratch, for a Rocketship of a business that will scale in size and international footprint.

They know what matters to people - both inside and outside work – and value them as individuals; always finding opportunities to develop them while showing respect and appreciation.

We expect colleagues at all levels to embrace and live our purpose and our leadership culture by challenging themselves to identify issues that are most important for our clients, our people, and for society and make an impact that matters. We know leadership comes in all shapes and sizes, but our Leadership Charter helps all of our people understand what we’re looking for:
We live our purpose: we act as a role model, embracing and living our purpose and values, and recognising others for the impact they make

Deloitte Digital is looking to hire a future design research leader to grow our practice in Defence and Security.

We’re looking for a seasoned design research professional to take our design research practice in Defence and Security on to the next level. You’ll have 3-5 years’ experience in design research, in any industry (though we have a preference for prior experience of Defence and Security).

We are proud of the impact we have with our Defense and Security clients, the strength of our relationships, and the depth and breadth of our skills that we bring to help them achieve their mission – we are privileged to be asked to work with them at the heart of their biggest and most ambitious technology programmes.

We help our clients with all aspects of analytics from developing their strategies through to implementing solutions. We cross the divide that other suppliers to Government cannot bridge – we embed deeply with our clients to discover their needs, innovate with them and pull the most impactful solution through to operational usage. We then help their business to change and adapt whilst coaching and mentoring their team at all levels.

We are especially interested in hearing from researchers with a background in both qualitative and quantitative methodologies with digital research backgrounds. You should be an expert in getting to the heart of the research question, thrive at understanding the complex and to be an engaging storyteller, bringing your insights into human behavior to life. Fundamentally though, we want someone who will thrive working with the largest and complex organisations in the Defence and Security sectors. Someone who embraces the unmatched opportunity for growth and development possible within the Deloitte Digital team.

251,User experience designer,London,Senior/Lead Product Designer,-1,"We’re looking for Senior Product Designers to lead design in teams working on our core personal and business banking products. Whichever team you join, the impact and remit of this role is huge.

The Monzo current account is a daily part of life for more than 4 million people already, and your work here will shape the way that people interact with their finances in brand new ways.

Our business bank account is an earlier-stage product that was launched just this spring across Android, iOS and web. We now have a highly engaged and fast-growing user base of businesses, and we're building and iterating rapidly.

We care deeply about inclusive working practices and diverse teams. We’re keen to ensure we’re designing a bank that works for everyone, so we particularly encourage applications from different underrepresented demographics.

What you’ll do everyday
You’ll lead design for a product area. This includes driving the future vision of this area, making sure it compliments a cohesive overall Monzo experience, and delivering on incremental steps to help the team head in this direction.
You’ll be embedded in a cross-functional product squad. You’ll be responsible for all design artefacts produced; from initial discovery and user journey mapping through to the execution of final UI design details.
You’ll deeply understand the customers you’re designing for. Whether it’s joining user research sessions, learning from previous insights, reading data reports or running your own lightweight research and analysis, you’ll strive to understand the what, why and how of the problems you’re solving for to ensure we don’t just ship the thing right, but we ship the right thing.
You’ll collaborate regularly using strong communication, documentation and facilitation skills. You’ll work closely with PMs, Engineers, Data scientists, User researchers and Writers to make sure your team isn’t just shipping great designs, but they are deeply involved throughout the design process.
You’ll execute (and advocate for) polished, intuitive and accessible user experiences. You’re pragmatic and able to balance the ideal experience with knowing where and when to make scoping trade-offs based on technical constraints, experimentation strategy or business risk.
You’ll help raise the bar for design at Monzo. We’re a small but mighty team where every designer plays a critical role in improving our community of practice—whether that’s through improving our craft skills to leading rituals to giving great feedback.
You’ll regularly work with a design director and product leadership. This is to help make sure long-term strategy, business goals and experience quality are all in alignment and that there are healthy opportunities for visibility and feedback.
Projects you could work on
Our core banking features such as budgeting for Monzo's iPhone and Android apps. Visibility and control of money across multiple accounts: we want Monzo to be the financial hub of your life, and something this ambitious requires a lot of good design.
Taking our new Monzo Plus account to the next level and creating valuable and desirable new premium features for our customers.
Core features for our new business banking apps across Android, iOS and web. More on our transparent roadmap for business accounts.
You should apply if
You’ve led the design of world-class product launches in a fast-growing company before.
You understand that good design is not about trends but is built on top of principles and tradeoffs. You make well-reasoned design decisions always advocating for the best possible user experience.
You’re passionate about inclusive design and accessibility, and you’ll design with all our users in mind.
You care about the UI design details but are also comfortable zooming out, seeing the broader picture and connecting the dots to create a cohesive overall experience.
You’re passionate about sharing your knowledge, and raising the bar for design practice at Monzo. Previous experience mentoring designers is a big plus.
You understand that writing is designing, you're a confident writer, and the copy in your screens is never an afterthought.
This isn’t for you if
You’ve not worked as part of an in-house product development team to launch a consumer-facing product or feature before. We know there are many great designers in agencies and consultancies, but due to the seniority of this role, we require strong experience embedded as a key member of a product development team.
You want to focus on people management. While mentoring other designers and levelling up the team is an expectation at this level, the initial scope of the role will focus on being an individual contributor. Things change quickly at Monzo though so there could be future people management opportunities if you’re interested in this path.
You need top-down direction. We operate extremely autonomously so you’ll be expected to determine the highest impact areas to work on, collaborating with your product squad and manager to ensure there’s alignment here.
Salary and location particulars
We explain salary bands as part of our initial calls. We want to be able to have a dialogue with candidates about what we pay and why, and answer any questions they have in the moment. See more details on our benefits package here.

You will plan and conduct user research in order to uncover user needs. You will analyse and translate this research into meaningful and actionable insights and communicate these findings and recommendations to team members and senior stakeholders. You will be able to convert these insights into high quality, best-in-class user experience design artefacts, for further testing & iteration.

You will bring a strong understanding of both quantitative and qualitative research methodologies, as well as best practices and core principles of great UX design. You will have demonstrable experience and understanding of working within the GDS methodology.

You will work with clients in a variety of sectors, with a focus on Public Sector. We are proud to use digital to create ingenious solutions and positive outcomes for the public sector. We work on cutting edge assignments in the largest government departments.

About Us

Product Madness burst into life in 2007 as the brainchild of two Stanford Business MBA graduates who possessed an innate love of gaming. Initially, the entrepreneurs developed casual games for Facebook and mobile, before having a ‘light-bulb moment’ in 2009 and refocusing their efforts with laser-guided precision on the exploding social casino genre. They have been bringing world-class social slots to real slots fans ever since! Now part of Aristocrat Leisure, Product Madness have published hit titles Heart of Vegas, Cashman Casino, Lightning Link and FaFaFa on Facebook, iOS and Android platforms and have grown considerably in size over the past year.

Product Madness’ dedication to promoting diversity and inclusion is clearly reflected in all our content and across all our platforms.

We are fully focused on equality and believe deeply in diversity of age, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender reassignment, maternity, marriage or civil partnership, religion, race and all the other fascinating characteristics that make us different.

What is great about working at Product Madness?

Like all game studios, we have a fully stocked kitchen, foosball table, games room, lunches/breakfasts, beanbags to sit on and much more… but we know this isn’t what makes us unique. What makes us stand out from the crowd is the autonomy we provide our employees, the opportunity to work on top grossing titles and the professional development opportunities that everyone has access to. We understand that our employees are the key to our success and so ensure we pay above the industry standard and offer a comprehensive benefits package. That doesn’t mean to say it's all work and no play, we have a lot of fun creating games from our swanky office in Liverpool Street, as well as having a great social community that is truly reflective of the diverse teams we have here!

When you join SSE, you'll join our OVO-wide community of researchers and designers. UX at OVO means helping teams see their product through the eyes of real people—understanding their context, motivations, and needs—so we can improve things for everyone.

We use whatever methods and media best suit the challenge, and inform strategic choices about where improvements could have the greatest impact. We love design workshops, exciting colleagues about service design, improving our accessibility, and putting participants first in our research; check out all our blogs. We fall in love with the problem, not our solutions.

OVO exists to power human progress with clean and affordable energy for all. We're here to challenge the status quo: to do what's right, find a better way, and build something great. We embrace simplicity, transparency, and treating people and our planet fairly. We understand that attracting and keeping the best talent is key to our forward-thinking future, so our people will always share in our success. Our benefits are nice too.

We want to build teams which represent a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills, and we hire on the basis of merit and potential. So get in touch, ask lots of questions.",-1,OVO External,"London, England",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
