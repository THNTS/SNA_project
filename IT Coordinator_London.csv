We are working together with our beneficiaries and partners to make the end of HIV transmission a reality. Through digital technology, and bold, new ways of reaching those in need, we will reduce transmission, improve sexual health and help people living with HIV thrive.

Why Deliveroo? When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us.

We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We’re a technology driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world, so come and join us for the ride.

What you’ll be doing:

You’ll partner with the tech recruitment team and hiring managers to ensure a best-in-class candidate experience
You’ll need to be super organised and be able to juggle conflicting diaries & priorities across the recruitment team and hiring managers
You’ll be solution-driven and be happy to share ideas on how we can do things better and more efficiently - you’ll be able to own these projects to see them become a reality!
In a nutshell, you’ll be scheduling interviews as well as tracking interviewer load, interviewer onboarding, managing recruitment agencies, arranging debriefs and managing our applicant tracking system.

Skills you’ll need:

You’ll be naturally organised: do you love planning things with friends and family? Are you the one who’s pulling everyone together and suggesting dates, times and locations?
You’ll be comfortable managing a high volume of requests which will come from recruiters, hiring managers and candidates
You should look beyond day to day activity and suggest/ implement process improvements both in the recruitment team and the hiring process.
You’ll be able to prioritise across multiple tasks with a focus on time and expectation management and to take a self-starting approach to your day
Strong communication skills as you’ll be working closely with our candidates to give them a great experience and to create a seamless recruitment process for our hiring managers/interviewers

If you have experience with an ATS, ideally Greenhouse, that would be beneficial.

Life at Deliveroo

We are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.

And, when it comes to looking for opportunities to create value by transferring knowledge and sharing skills and insights with the wider organisation, again, we'll count on you to deliver.

About you

You'll need a good understanding of how user-focussed digital services can improve people's lives, plus a real desire to help people struggling with bad housing or homelessness. You'll also need experience of delivering with cross-functional teams and/or collaborating with experts from other teams and bringing together different digital specialists and enabling them to work together effectively to a common aim. The ability to effectively communicate the principles of good digital practice and technical details of web development with technical and non-technical audiences is important too, and, if you've worked within the not for profit sector, either as part of an in-house team or as a supplier, even better, although this is not essential. What is for certain though is that you're proactive, creative, commercially aware and great at collaborating on a range of digital projects.

Benefits

We offer a wide range of benefits, including 30 days of annual leave, enhanced family friendly policies, pension and interest free travel loans. Our employees also have access to a tenancy deposit loan, payroll giving, cycle to work scheme and an employee assistance programme.

Shelter helps millions of people every year struggling with bad housing or homelessness through our advice, support and legal services. And we campaign to make sure that, one day, no one will have to turn to us for help. We're here so no one has to fight bad housing or homelessness on their own.

Safeguarding is everyone's business. Shelter is committed to protecting the health, wellbeing and human rights of those we support, and enabling them to live free from harm, abuse and neglect. All our staff will be expected to observe professional standards of behaviour and conduct their work in line with our Safeguarding Policies.

Shelter promotes equality, diversity and inclusion in our workplace. We make employment decisions by matching business needs with skills and experience of candidates, irrespective of age, disability (including hidden disabilities),gender, gender identity or gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, or sexual orientation.

We are happy to talk about flexible working, personal growth, and to promote a workplace where you can be yourself and achieve success based only on your merit.

IT support is fully outsourced except for the role of the Head of IT which is retained in-house. It is a busy environment and due to increases in activity, an additional role requirement has been identified to support and assist the Head of IT and the organisation more broadly with operational IT matters.
The new IT Service Delivery Manager position is a varied and very much hands-on role. There are significant technical requirements but also a level of administrative support. The role reports into the Head of IT.

Working with the Head of IT to assist with licensing management of SaaS and other software applications.
Working with the Head of IT to assist with processing invoices: this process is mainly cross-checking invoices with the PO’s and budget.
Working with the Head of It to coordinate projects, project resources and assist with maintenance of project plans. We do not require PRINCE2 qualifications, but an understanding of project management lifecycles would be useful.
To attend and provide input into regular service reviews with suppliers.
To support the Head of IT in product and market research for identifying and reviewing new and innovative technology solutions.

An Introduction to RetrofitWorks.
RetrofitWorks has taken a leadership position in the housing refurbishment sector to create a self-sustaining market to transform the poorly performing existing housing stock of the UK. The existing housing stock is responsible for a significant proportion of UK carbon dioxide emissions, increasing energy bills for occupants and in some cases the cause of ill health and discomfort, and we are changing that.

RetrofitWorks is run for and by each local community, building on existing local supply chains and services, and ensuring more economic and social value – wealth, jobs, skills – is retained in the local area. It has achieved this with two groups of members that drive and deliver not just energy efficiency services but moving into deeper retrofits:
Contractors*
Those providing high quality services and systems or those seeking work, be they trades or professions.
Advocates*
Organisations representing the interests of groups of householders or tenants. They understand needs and want to develop the market for retrofit to help them.

It is this unique joint ownership that enables real change.

233,IT Coordinator,London,Market Research Project Coordinator (Afternoon / Evening Shifts),-1,"We are looking for permanent candidates with fluent spoken and written English, to join a young and fast growing start up in Healthcare Market Research. A relaxed non-corporate work environment that also raises money for patient organisations and health charities as part of every project. Whilst previous healthcare market research experience would be ideal, you do not need direct experience in the industry (we will provide relevant training) however you need to be meticulously detailed, great on the phone, fully fluent in English and eager to learn. If you speak any other languages this is a bonus but is not required.
THE ROLE*
This is a predominantly phone based role whereby you will be responsible for registering patients and carers who have enquired about a market research project, checking participant eligibility, scheduling and dealing with enquiries in US (and to a lesser extent the UK and Canada). Your success will be judged on the number of calls you make and how many of these people successfully participate in the related project (and the feedback from these users about the process).
TYPE OF PERSON REQUIRED FOR THE ROLE*
Confident and eloquent, we require someone who can communicate effectively and sensitively with patients and carers and ‘sell’ the company to them. A self-starter who embraces challenges and loves speaking to people on the phone. This role would be perfect for a candidate with a call centre / sales / account management background that wants to join a young and vibrant company.

Due to the need to check user’s eligibility across multiple different criteria and the need for scheduling it also requires someone who has meticulous attention to detail and is very organised.
ABOUT US*
We are a health research community, based in East London, where patients and carers from across the world can get involved in research to get their opinions heard and raise money for themselves and the health charities that matter most to them. Mixing cutting edge technology and acquisition of respondents with smart, consultative fieldwork, this is the perfect step for someone who wants to work in an innovative, challenging and fast paced team. There is great opportunity for career growth for the right candidate. For more information about us please see www.liberatingresearch.com
WORKING HOURS*
We will consider full time and part time candidates for this role. Candidates can conduct this role remotely. During initial training you will be required to work a number of shifts during normal working hours so this crosses over with the rest of the team. These shifts can be agreed individually to ensure they work with your availability.

_Full Time Role: _

Full time hours would be 4pm – 1am (with some shifts 5pm – 2am) including a one hour break, Monday to Friday (so 8 hours per day / 40 hours per week)

_Part Time Role: _

We may also consider candidates who are interested in a part time role. Part time hours would include working a 4 hour shift in the evenings/at night, Monday to Friday between 8pm – midnight (with a smaller number of shifts starting at either 7pm, 9pm or 10pm). Initially you would also need to be available for 30 minutes each day (at some point between 4pm – 6pm - to be agreed) in order to cover project briefings from the rest of the team (who stop working at 6pm). Once you are trained and are comfortable with the setup then we would look to reduce the daily briefing requirements and would instead allocate time to conduct briefings with you approximately twice a week to avoid the need to be available every afternoon for briefings. Any of the 30 mins that are not used during the day would be added to the evening shift. So this role would be 4.5 hours per day / 22.5 hours per week.

The hours listed above for the Full Time and Part Time roles are the optimal hours, but we may be able to offer some flexibility on these hours if required (but you would need to be available to work shifts on all days, Monday – Friday).

As this role is mainly focused on US calling, some flexibility is required for shifts that fall on US federal holidays or other US holidays where calling cannot be done. In these instances, the relevant hours would be rescheduled for another suitable time (to be agreed between Liberating Research and the candidate on a case by case basis) so the hours can be made up at a more appropriate time.
SALARY*
£25,000 per annum for a full-time role (40 hours per week) or prorated for part time plus company pension. 31 days holiday per year (including bank holidays).
APPLICATIONS*
If you are interested in applying then please provide your CV as well as any additional information about any telephone based roles you have held in the past or any other relevant experience. Please confirm in your cover letter whether you are fluent in any other languages.

Please also confirm where you are based, whether you have somewhere quiet and secure to work from home, whether you are interested in a full time or part time role and what hours you are available to work (and that you are available on all working days, Monday – Friday)

Research Pharmacy Coordinator (SATO or Pharmacy technician) | Clinical Trial Dispensary | AfC Band 4

UCLH is one of the most complex NHS trusts in the UK, serving a large and diverse population from the local area and throughout the United Kingdom and overseas. The Trust mission is to deliver top-quality patient care, excellent education and world-class research across eight hospital sites. As a leading centre for both clinical research and cancer treatment, the Trust is involved in a high volume of clinical trials and is the highest recruiting site within the North Thames Clinical Research Network (CRN).

Through collaboration with UCL Partners, our designation as an Academic Health Science Centre (AHSC) has been renewed in 2020 for a further 5 years. Our AHSC drives the translation of innovative research into patient benefit. Our members have made significant contributions to the national efforts around COVID-19 through their world-leading research and clinical expertise.

The main base for the pharmacy clinical trials service is at University College Hospital (UCH). There are 2 early phase clinical research facility sites: one at the National Hospital for Neurology & Neurosurgery (NHNN) and one at the NIHR/UCLH Clinical Research Facility on Tottenham Court Road. There are other research active sites at the Macmillan Cancer Centre (MCC) and Mortimer Market Centre (MCC). Other research active sites within the Trust (Westmoreland Street and the Royal National ENT and Eastman Dental Hospitals) are supported remotely by the team. The site for this post will be based at the UCH.

Due to the amalgamation of 2 research sites and a change in team structure, an exciting opportunity has arisen for an enthusiastic and self-motivated AfC Band 4 Research Pharmacy Coordinator (or B4 pharmacy technician) to join the growing team.
