Raise the bar. Pushing ourselves and others to improve will be uncomfortable and at times result in failure. However, it's critical to our success. We're dedicated to creating a place where everyone feels challenged to improve.
Build a lever. We choose to build tools and infrastructure that will help others make world-changing innovations. There's less glory in it, but in the words of Archimedes, ""Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.""

Our brand is beloved and well known throughout the world—over 6 billion people have taken a SurveyMonkey survey! Today, more than 17 million active users rely on our platform to measure and understand feedback from employees, customers, website and app users, and the market. And our enterprise-grade products and solutions enable 335,000+ organizations globally to solve daily challenges—from delivering better customer experiences to increasing employee retention.

More about the Machine Learning Engineering team


The Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) team's charter is to build out a machine learning platform that accelerates the efficient adoption of machine learning across all SurveyMonkey portfolio products. Our goal is to build applications and tools that enable the scalability of ML along all points of the lifecycle of an AI project, from feature discovery to model training, from model deployment to post-production monitoring and evaluation.

A SurveyMonkey ML Engineer focuses on 3 specific areas of our ML platform:
Data
Data is the foundation of all ML projects. The MLE team builds tools to resolve all pain points that are specific to working with multi-dimensional datasets in a production environment
Serving
The MLE team supports services that serve ML models. The team focuses on extending and maintaining architecture that supports integration with other SurveyMonkey microservices
Automated Management
As the number of models and use cases increase, the MLE team aims to automate workflows like model retraining, model monitoring and evaluation
What we're looking for

We need your help as we continue to evolve our next generation machine learning platform here at SurveyMonkey. We help our customers make great decisions based on the tools we create on top of the millions of survey responses we receive daily. To do that well, we use applied machine learning techniques that include natural language processing, classification, spam detection, personalization / ranking, etc. We do this at significant scale and generally in real-time.

Successful candidates will have extensive application and data engineering experience. The ideal candidate will also have some experience with building production ML platforms in the cloud. Specifically, we need someone that is ready to get their hands dirty with building out a flexible machine learning platform that supports scalable model training in-memory or through distributed computational processing (single vs. multi-node), model deployment, API management, and constructing elegant feedback loops for self-sustaining machine learning systems. Candidates will need to be well-versed in large-scale data storage and processing and have the judgement to know when to use out-of-the-box solutions versus building custom ones. Being fun to work with is definitely a plus!.

You have
At least 7+ years professional software engineering experience using a high level language (Python preferred).
Experience utilizing big data and machine learning technologies (e.g. H2O, Spark, Hadoop, Cassandra).
Very comfortable with Unix/Linux operating systems. We favor Ubuntu.
Strong communication and documentation skills.
Experience with operating computational clusters for training machine learning models.

Benchling's mission is to accelerate the research that propels us towards this reality, and magnify its impact, through modern software.

Every day, hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world use Benchling in their efforts to solve humanity's most pressing problems. For these scientists, Benchling is the central technology they use to conduct their research.


Benchling was founded by a team of MIT graduates and has raised funding from Benchmark, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, and Y Combinator. Our customers include pharmaceutical giants, leading biotechs, and the world's most renowned research institutes.

WHAT YOU WILL DO
Own projects end-to-end, from initial design, to prototype, to large-scale rollout.
Design and implement backend models and API endpoints for complex scientific workflows.
Design and implement rich frontend components and architecture. We build and operate one of the largest, richest React applications out there and power complex scientific analyses.
Work closely with product managers, designers, marketing, and sales to ensure the right context is being shared.
Help rapidly scale our product and team. As a member of the engineering team, you'll be an integral part of how we mature our tooling, best practices, engineering processes, and hiring.
ABOUT YOU
Have 3+ years of experience in software engineering.
Build software with a product-first approach. You ship code quickly and care about the real world impact of your code.
Have strong abilities in problem solving and iterating on feedback.
Enjoy ownership and building key pieces of product.
Are interested in learning more about life science (prior knowledge is not required; desire to learn is a must).
YOU MIGHT WORK ON

Check out our engineering blog for some examples of past work. Here are some other examples of recent and future projects:
Tools to simulate DNA assembly - computers can assist scientists by informing scientific decisions with complex calculations. Our bulk assembly tool allows scientists to simulate constructing hundreds of DNA constructs in parallel, visualizing the end result and highlighting potential issues.
Complex querying and visualization tools - The big advantage of keeping all your data stored in one system is that you can query that data all at once, without digging up multiple sources. This works best when you can query Benchling the same way you can query a database: by choosing from a large number of possible filters on any related objects, joining together various sources, and performing aggregations. We want to enable this in a user-friendly experience, without leaving your browser.
A customizable computation platform - Biologics are typically large protein complexes composed of a number of shared parts. We want to let scientists specify computations that can aggregate data across all of these related entities to surface derived values, which can be used in everything from data analysis to naming schemes. Scientists may develop custom protein analysis algorithms or proprietary validation logic - they'll be able to hook in custom code and push that computation to Benchling.
Data warehouse as a product - customers can click a button and spin up a fully-managed, query-able warehouse with all their Benchling data in one place. Customers get the full power of Redshift/Postgres without having to manage ETL pipelines or tune Postgres configuration values.
A new permissions system - Our existing permission system relies on Read/Write/Admin access that can only be applied at the top level of the file hierarchy. To roll out to enterprises with 500+ users, we need to offer them fine-grained control around exactly what actions a user can take and let them manage these in a hierarchical fashion.
OUR VALUES
Empower through information. We explain the ""why"" behind every decision, unless there are highly sensitive circumstances. We're honest about how we're doing, especially in difficult times. We believe that sharing information builds trust and enables better decision-making.
Rely on tenacity. Hard work is one of the greatest factors to determine success and is fully under our control. We must make the most of every day by bringing the highest level of determination. Dreaming big is not enough.
Raise the bar. Pushing ourselves and others to improve will be uncomfortable and at times result in failure. However, it's critical to our success. We're dedicated to creating a place where everyone feels challenged to improve.
Build a lever. We choose to build tools and infrastructure that will help others make world-changing innovations. There's less glory in it, but in the words of Archimedes, ""Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.""
