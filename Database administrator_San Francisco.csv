Across three core Initiative focus areas of Science, Education and Justice and Opportunity, we're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and movement building, to help build an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.

Our Values


We believe we can help build a future for everyone.
We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.
We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.
Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.
Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

The Opportunity


Our goal is to provide every student, and every teacher, the opportunity to reach his or her full potential. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative supports and develops personalized learning experiences that are passionate about and led by the learner - meeting them where they are cognitively, physically, socially and emotionally. We're looking for engineers to help bring a new personalized learning platform to the globe's generation of students and help advance the potential of humanity.

Essai, Inc. is in search of inquisitive, creative, determined candidates who enjoy problem-solving and taking a theoretical concept into real-world applications to fill our *(System Administrator) *position.

Essai, Inc. is a dynamic and innovative high-tech manufacturing company located in *(**Fremont, CA**)*. We are looking for exceptional individuals to join our team, who have high desire and drive to succeed both personally and professionally, in a fast paced and growing company. Located in the heart of Silicon Valley, Essai is a diverse, environmental-friendly company whose commitment to excellence has been recognized by America’s Fastest–Growing Private 5000 Companies.
JOB RESPONSIBILITY*
This is an excellent opportunity for an experienced Microsoft Windows Server systems administrator at our automated manufacturing and assembly plant located in the east side of the Silicon Valley in Fremont, CA. This position will be responsible for the day-to-day technical support, administration, maintenance, and documentation of an existing production network of servers, manufacturing control and engineering workstations, and desktop and laptop PCs, under the supervision of managing IT personnel.

In addition to day-to-day technical support, your primary responsibility will be maintaining the IT infrastructure and supporting environment that keeps our automated manufacturing machines’ spindles spinning. Therefore, this is a 24x7x365 on-call position, which includes monitoring critical system alerts. Occasional early, late, and/or long hours are required.

To be successful, you must be able to work independently, Monday–Friday from 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM, cultivate professional relationships with key stakeholders throughout the facility, and maintain a positive and enthusiastic approach. Importantly, you must stop, listen to and triage internal IT customer’s issues on demand, isolate or escalate their technical problems, and execute appropriate solutions for them.
MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS*
TECHNICAL COMPETENCE: Four years of solid Microsoft Windows Server operating experience in a corporate networked environment that demonstrates a broad skillset. This skillset should include: comprehensive knowledge of Microsoft Active Directory, DNS and DHCP, internal trust relationships, file systems, rights and permissions, access tokens and ACLs, and the Computer Browser Service — the basics of Windows file services.

Strong working knowledge of Windows administrative tools and command-line utilities. Clear understanding of IPv4 addressing, IP subnetting, IP routing, and TCP/IP core protocols and services in addition to DNS and DHCP: including ARP, ICMP, SMTP, RPC, HTTP, SSL and SMB/CIFS — to name a few — along with their associated utilities. The methods and sequence of name resolution for commands and tools that use the WinSock and NetBIOS interfaces.

Familiarity with the physical media and working characteristics of IEEE 802.3 Ethernet specifications, TIA Category 5/5e/6/6A cabling standards, and TIA-568B pinouts; the address space of the private internets as defined in RFCs 1918 and 3927; along with IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi concepts and SNIA standard RAID levels. Exchange Server and VMware administration experience is a plus.

COMMUNICATION SKILLS: To achieve our communications skills requirements you should be formally and rigorously trained and have a Microsoft MCSE certification — or a current Microsoft equivalent — in one of the various Microsoft Windows Server generations starting with Windows 2000 Server or above. Your certification(s) should include passed exams in TCP/IP core protocols and services.

We want you to be able to accurately convey technical concepts in English both to colleagues and, with a suitable adjustment, to non-technical internal IT customers. As an essential adjunct to work experience, education and other achievements, we’ve found that people with formal vendor skills-based training who have diligently put in the effort to pass exams and earn an appropriate vendor certification have developed a naturally accompanying aptitude and vocabulary to communicate these technical concepts and complex ideas quickly, clearly and concisely.

A necessary consequence of supporting our fast-paced production environment with these types of skills is that you must also be able to speak and write in English, easily, fluently, and coherently.

Reciting the NATO phonetic alphabet in under 10 seconds, cold, is a definite plus.

RIGHT ATTITUDE: In addition to technical competence and communication skills, we place a high premium on right attitude. Behavior is important. We are looking for an individual who is willing to be a first point of contact for the IT department in Fremont, who has a track record of offering a customer-oriented mindset, and who has an established history of collaborating with colleagues.

On a day-to-day basis, this requires (a) being present Monday–Friday from 8:00 – 5:00 PM, (b) reaching out to, cultivating, and maintaining excellent, open channels of communication with internal IT customers, and (c) providing quick and positive responses to your teammates in the IT department by being readily forthcoming and fulsome with your technical knowledge, skills, and configurations — passing them on freely, without obligation.

An easy, genuine, gracious willingness to drop what you’re doing and serve other people on demand — both customers and teammates, alike — is an expectation! Likewise, the ability to expand your consciousness beyond yourself in an attempt to see and take into account other people’s viewpoints with a little dry wit, a friendly smile, and a great sense of humor is most welcome!
SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, AND ABILITIES REQUIRED*
A Bachelor of Science degree in science, technology, engineering, or math is certainly preferred, but not required. We will also gladly welcome degrees in music, languages, linguistics, or related disciplines that share the cognitive domains of metrical structure, recursion, and the use of memory. Again, not required, but unquestionably a plus.

On the other hand, as many people have proven, college degrees are not always the be-all/end-all requirement for fruitful economic participation or a great career. However, if for no other reason, the process of attaining any four-year degree demonstrates a worthwhile common denominator: it shows the extent to which we are willing to exert our will power, exercise self-control, set aside other desires, and sustain these disciplines over long durations to achieve something of significance.

Knowing what we want, setting long-term goals, resolving to accomplish them, procuring funding, associating with people who can help us get what we want, reliably fulfilling obligations, planning our work, adhering to a schedule, balancing our lives, devoting our energies efficiently and effectively, working and playing well with others, accepting correction — all while using our volition over four years to responsibly execute a wide variety of difficult tasks, stick with them, and see them all through to completion — a college degree tells an employer quite a lot.

So, if you do not have a four-year college degree but you meet the minimum qualifications, listed above — technical competence, communication skills, and right attitude — and you can truly establish in writing, by outlining a history of previous achievements, your abilities to plan, manage and execute tasks, and see assignments and projects through to completion with little to no supervision, then we’ll happily consider that in lieu of a four-year degree. If this is the case, please be equipped with a list of your lifetime achievements, briefly stated on a single sheet of paper.

You should also be able to sit and work at a computer keyboard with a mouse for extended periods of time; stoop, kneel, bend and reach from the waist on a daily basis; leverage a hand truck, operate and push/pull a pallet jack, and climb a ladder or ride a scissor lift to service enclosure-, rack-, floor-, wall-, or ceiling-mounted equipment. Occasionally, you’ll need to be able to move and lift up to 60 pounds above your waste or 50 pounds overhead — equivalents of a box of 10 reams of paper, 24 and 20 lb., respectively.

Please come prepared with three professional references, listing your supervisors from previous employers that can substantiate your background, including their current contact information.
Please Note: * This position is for our *(**Fremont, CA**)* location. There is no relocation assistance or visa sponsorship offered at this time. Job offers are pending successful completion of a background check, drug screen, and reference check.
Due to the large volume of resumes received, we are unable to acknowledge receipt of all applications. Candidates who meet specific qualifications will be contacted during the course of this search.

About Us: At Emendata, we help bridge the gap between data and the real world. We partner with organizations that have a social mission and help them tackle their problems using analytics. Our role in these partnerships goes end to end—we handle everything from wrangling the data to analyzing the problem to turning the results into something actionable. Importantly, we understand that this analytics pipeline does not live in a vacuum. Getting to meaningful numbers requires more than just the right methods; it calls for understanding the people, policies, data, and systems involved. With this approach, our small but fast-growing team is having a big impact, taking on challenges like using analytics to combat fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare.
About the Role: This role leads the way in producing analytics that reflect a deep level of understanding and a high degree of quality. We are looking for you to:
Take analyses from end to end: Understand the client’s problem, identify the right research question, plan the methodology, corral the data, code the analysis, interpret the results, craft the deliverable, and communicate the story
Apply a research mentality: Use all tools at our disposal (documentation, policy regulations, data investigations, etc.) to make sound analytic decisions
Help the team deliver its best work: Turn direction from clients/senior staff into tactical plans and work closely with data analysts to help them implement (conducting code reviews, teaching/reinforcing analytic strategies, etc.)
This role will be a good fit for people who naturally push towards progress and are undeterred when that requires a lot of effort or stepping into unfamiliar territory. Emendata is growing rapidly, and we are looking for people who are excited to march forward together.
Qualifications: If you do not meet all the criteria below but still think you would be a good fit for this role, please apply so we can see if we can find the right spot for you on the team. We value experience but also welcome aptitude and enthusiasm.
Education: Bachelor’s or master’s degree in a quantitative field or equivalent technical training
Programming: Experience with SAS is a must (comfortable with SAS macro language, advanced DATA step techniques such as hashes, and PROC SQL); experience with Python, Stata, R, or SQL is a plus
Technical Mentorship: Demonstrated experience with reviewing code and providing feedback
Data Management: Comfortable with the process of importing, cleaning, and preparing data for analysis in a reproducible way
Analysis: Exceptional problem-solving skills with a good understanding of statistical/social science research methods; 4+ years hands-on experience in an analytics role (e.g., economic consulting)
Working Style: Intellectually curious (keep pulling on threads until finding an answer), enterprising (eager to tackle the unknown and find a way to make things happen), and collaborative (work with others to explore, build, tear down, and build again)
To be considered for this position, applicants must have the ability to work in the U.S. without a need for current or future visa sponsorship.
About the Interview Process: We want both sides to learn what it would be like to work together. Part way through the interview process, we incorporate a lightweight at-home exercise that serves as the basis for a technical interview. The exercise gives us an outlet to show you what kind of problems this role would tackle and offers you an opportunity to show us how you would approach the work.",-1,Emendata,"Burlingame, CA",-1,1 to 50 Employees,-1,Company - Private,-1,-1,Less than $1 million (USD),-1

In Corporate Risk Management we provide an integrated risk management strategy that supports the delivery of predictable financial and operational performance in order to produce successful client and shareholder outcomes. We are organized around six primary functions: Enterprise Risk; Credit, Market, and Investment Risk; Information Security Risk; Model Risk; Operational Risk; and Financial Crimes Risk.

What you are good at


You will work in Financial Crimes Risk Management (FCRM), one of the six primary Risk Management functions at Schwab. Among other things, this team manages the risk of loss in Money Movement services offered through Schwab Bank and Brokerage affiliates.

More specifically, you will join the (FDP) Fraud Data Platforms Department, within Financial Crimes Risk Management. FDP is primarily responsible for:
Fraud Prevention Data
Fraud Prevention Platforms/Technology
As a Fraud Data Engineer for the FDP department, you will primarily perform four duties:
Data Engineering; Collaborating, sourcing, ingesting, redefining, storing, curating, querying and preparing data
Application Development; Write original code to develop SQL Server Objects and .NET GUI enhancements
Data Platform Administration; Includes but is not limited to application audits, tests, controls, compliance and regulatory administration
Data Platform Migration; Potentially migrating homegrown data applications to Enterprise support.
It is very important to note that although this is a technical position, it is on the Business side of Schwab and not on the Technology side of the company. This means you act as your own Business Analyst, and you are confident interacting with many different partners both in-person, and through technology. In other words, you are first and foremost a Cyber, Risk and Fraud Professional who protects our clients from crime. Secondarily you are a skilled Technologist who also understands the importance of tech administration.

It is also important to note that early on you will primarily work in a Microsoft Stack environment; specifically in SQL Server, Visual Studio and as a .NET UI Developer. As our department and therefore our technology progresses, you may be spending more time in Big Data environments such as Hadoop, or Cloud environments such as GCP or AWS. This transition will take time, but it is important to have an interest in updating your skills as required.

Data Engineering:You are an experienced Data Engineer and .NET UI Developer working as an individual contributor and self-reliant decision maker. However, although your business title is “Data Engineer,” you are a Tech Generalist with a broad background in several areas including: Software Engineer/Developer, Systems Engineer, Release Engineer, and Data/Systems Architect. Additionally, and as needed, you will play an active role as your own Production Support for fraud prevention applications, primarily in the

Microsoft Stack.

Responsibilities include assessing business partner data needs, then sourcing, ingesting, redefining, blending, automating, storing, querying and preparing those data to meet analytical or reporting needs. Among other things this may involve contacting vendors as well as internal Schwab departments and product owners, researching data dictionaries and navigating legacy as well as modern data systems. Examples of data assets you may work with include web, client, account, transaction and more. Partners relying on your data create fraud prevention strategies through a range of simple-to-advanced analytics. Among other Risk Management topics, Client Experience and Crime Prevention are central themes, particularly as they relate to money movement channels such as Wire, ACH, Card, Check, Bill Pay, Account Open, etc.

Application Development:One of our primary applications is currently written in .NET. From time to time you will be asked to write enhancements. Over time this application may get migrated but initially, GUI improvements will be one of your four primary responsibilities.

Data Platform Administration:Platform administration is foundational to compliance, and being on the business side of technology you will often be your own administrator. This includes but is not limited to application audits, tests, controls, compliance and regulatory paperwork. Financial Services is a regulated industry meaning timely administration is important to our clients and our company.

Data Platform Migration:As Charles Schwab matures, you may play a role in migrating older, “homegrown” data-tech platforms, supported by you, to enterprise-level platforms developed by you, but supported by Enterprise Technology Services. This transition will take time which means as a Technologist, perseverance is your strength. Like many financial services companies, Schwab is migrating to Big Data and Cloud, but given our responsibility to safely manage our clients’ assets, this change will take time.

Overall Crucial Duties Include:
Improve the Client/Brand experience while helping to minimize financial crimes.
Share responsibility for protecting clients and company from criminal activity such as ID theft, Scams, Synthetic ID, Account Take-Over and New Account Fraud.
Develop technical connections to new data sources such as relational databases, NoSQL databases, Hadoop, NAS drives, weblogs, Hive tables and distributed file systems and applications.
Ingest new data into SQL Server databases.
Build data objects, job flows, code and applications.
Work with vendors and internal and external business partners to acquire new data feeds to advise risk management and fraud prevention activities.
Share technical ownership of the Risk Data infrastructure including databases, data objects, GUIs and job flows.
Modernize, automate, maintain and scale data-related processes and infrastructure.
Move large amounts of data, write original data management and GUI development code, create custom views and data sets.
Store and manage sensitive data in SQL Server and Hadoop.
Regularly deliver ad-hoc data solutions such as simple-to-complex queries and analytic data sets.
Act as your own application administrator and production support.
Develop in a .NET UI environment.
Take an interactive and visible role within your department as well as with business partners.
