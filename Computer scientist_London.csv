Background
The postholder will be a key researcher in an MRC-funded project to study the mechanisms of response and resistance to novel epigenetic therapies in Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML). This position will be supervised by Dr Lynn Quek, based in King's College London's Denmark Hill Campus.
AML is an aggressive bone marrow cancer which is incurable in the majority of patients. Our focus is to improve our understanding this disease with an ultimate aim to translate this knowledge to better treatments for patients. The focus of our research is to better understand the biology of leukaemia propagating cells in patient-derived AML which are mutated in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 genes. This important group of AMLs account for 20-30% of all AMLs.
Inhibitors of mutant IDH enzymes such as Ivosidenib and Enasidenib have recently been developed and FDA-approved to treat IDH-mutant AML. We have shown that IDH inhibitors restore blood function in AML patients by inducing differentiation of leukaemic cells previously unable to differentiate normally into mature blood cells (Amatangelo et al. Blood, 2017). We recently described the clonal dynamics of response and resistance to IDH inhibitor therapy in patients and demonstrated the impact of clonal heterogeneity on the function of AML cells in vivo (Quek et al. Nature Medicine, 2018).
We are looking for an ambitious research scientist with excellent computational skills and experience, who takes pride in performing scientific work to high technical standards. The successful candidate will have excellent organisation skills, who can demonstrate that (s)he is ready to take on new challenges. This postholder will be a key member of a team to study the metabolic and epigenetic events which underlie cell fate decisions in human patient IDH-mutant AML cells treated with IDH inhibitors, and be involved in analysis of clinical trial data.
This work requires expertise in analysis NGS data including WES, bulk and single cell RNA-seq and single cell ATAC-seq. Knowledge of methylation-seq would be an advantage. Previous experience of medical statistics and analysis of clinical data is desirable. The candidate should have a good understanding of laboratory techniques used to study haematopoiesis and leukaemia, including multi-omics and flow cytometry. The postholder will be expected to be self-driven in developing new skills. The postholder may be asked to co-supervise junior members of team and provide training in computational methods.
We are able to offer wider support and networking with computational teams within our network of collaborative research groups within KCL.
The successful candidate will have a good track record in Haematology research, demonstrate self-motivation, independent critical thinking, flexibility and good teamwork. This post will be ideal for a computational scientist who has a background in Clinical Haemato-oncology, especially in myeloid malignancies and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. There may be opportunities for additional clinical work that would attract additional clinical pay supplements (e.g. supporting outpatient clinics and clinical trials activity) for the suitably qualified individual.
Dr Quek is especially interested in helping promising researchers develop their career and will suit an early career clinical academic looking for post-doctoral experience prior to application for a post-doctoral intermediate research fellowship. This project will provide excellent scientific training, working in an area that has direct relevance to patient care.
This post will be offered as a full-time, fixed term contract for 24 months.

A bit more about us


We’re a diverse group of people. With backgrounds ranging from data science to music production, more than 80% of our team come from outside the world of finance – providing us with a unique perspective as we help consumers feel more in control of their lives. For us, an interest in people comes first; finance follows.

More about what we're doing


The apps and infrastructure we’re building are designed to place the power of personal data back into the hands of normal people. Picture this: a world where your bank knew you were paying too much for your gas bill and could switch you to a more suitable provider, or understood your savings targets and could automatically find you a better deal. That’s what we’re working towards.

We believe that diversity will make us better.


Bud’s mission is to make the money part of people’s lives simple. To get there, we need a workforce that is diverse as the people we create our products for. Which means we need people who have different backgrounds and experiences, who are diverse in age, gender identity, race, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, ethnicity, and ways of thinking. We truly believe that these differences will make us grow as a company and a team. We strive to create a workplace and culture where our people are empowered, supported, given equal opportunities and can bring their authentic selves to work.

At Deliveroo we have a world class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.
Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.
Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.
Our data scientists come from many disciplines including mathematics, statistics, economics/econometrics, physics, psychology, finance, computer science, operations research, cognitive neuroscience and engineering. Some are formally trained in data science, some are not. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.
Data Science at Deliveroo
We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

About the Role
As an Economist in the Data Science organisation at Deliveroo you will help scale our business and improve the experience for restaurants, riders, and eaters. Using experimental or observational data, you will get to help answer questions like:
Which markets/cities should we enter next?
How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?
What is the business impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?
How do we best optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?
How does a new competitor’s entry into one of our markets affect our growth ambitions?
Can the Delivery food market sustain multiple players?
What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants?
What impact do online reviews have?
How will a change in the user interface affect customer choice behavior?
The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.
Qualifications:
Always curious and willing to learn new skills
A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset
Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business-relevant economic problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail
Masters degree or PhD (preferred) in Economics or Econometrics
Ideally industry experience since the completion of your academic career
Proficiency with analytical tools like R/Python and familiarity with SQL
Ability to understand and design markets and incentives taking into account the information environment and strategic interactions
Excellent people skills — you’ll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into economic problems.

Benefits and Diversity
At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.",3.5,"Deliveroo

About the Role
At Deliveroo we have a world class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.
Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.
Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.
Our data scientists come from many disciplines including mathematics, statistics, economics/econometrics, physics, psychology, finance, computer science, operations research, cognitive neuroscience and engineering. Some are formally trained in data science, some are not. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

As a data scientist at Deliveroo, your main goal is business impact. You will help answer questions like:
Which markets/cities should we enter next?
How should we improve our consumer, rider, and restaurant apps?
How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?
What is the business impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?
How do we best optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?
How does a new competitor’s entry into one of our markets affect our growth ambitions?
Can the food delivery market sustain multiple players?
What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
How should we make investment decisions company-wide?
How should we decide which rider to assign to a given order?
Which restaurants should we show a given customer?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?
What impact do online reviews have?
How will a change in the user interface affect customer choice behaviour?
The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

Data Science at Deliveroo
We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them. There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind?
At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Qualifications:
Always curious and willing to learn new skills
Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences
A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset
Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail
Proficiency with analytical tools like R/Python and familiarity with SQL
A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact
Excellent people skills — you’ll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into data science problems

Benefits and Diversity
At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.",3.5,"Deliveroo

The impact you will have

This role is a great opportunity for someone who likes to make an immediate impact on a company’s cutting edge products. You will play a key role in supporting Elliptic’s data strategy by continuously building out our data set and the tools to enhance it, remaining in tune with market trends, and ahead of the curve in terms of threat actor behaviour, particularly in the realm of cybercrime. With millions of transactions generated every day, there are endless questions to answer and problems to solve. With access to our own proprietary data, you will be in a unique position to address these.

The role

Data Scientists at Elliptic engage in large-scale data collection efforts, exploratory data analysis, fundamental blockchain research, and make use of a range of techniques spanning across computer science, graph theory, machine learning, and statistics. A significant fraction of our effort is devoted to deciphering and de-anonymising blockchain patterns and anomalies, with particular attention to criminal activity (such as, identifying dark market activity on the blockchain). Data Scientists also write research papers and collaborate with academia (here is an example of what we have been working on).

Your day-to-day will also involve
Conducting independent research to uncover unique patterns of blockchain actors (such as services, dark markets, …); turning these observations first into code, and then into production data for client-facing products
Collaborating with other data scientists and engineers to enhance our existing models, and think creatively about new ones
Staying up-to-date with the latest cryptocurrency research
Maintaining and developing existing Python and Scala codebase
Helping internal teams answer data-specific questions
Who we are

At Elliptic, we believe cryptocurrency will play a huge role in the future of value transfer, and we care deeply about helping to build this future. In order for cryptocurrency to flourish, it’s important to prevent criminal abuse of the technology. Elliptic is the global leader in detecting, preventing, and pursuing criminal activity in cryptocurrencies.

Our customers include the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, financial institutions and government agencies. Our unique platform gives us an unparalleled understanding of cryptocurrency capital flows, using a combination of network science and machine learning to aggregate and interpret vast quantities of transaction data. We provide anti-money laundering (AML) compliance software and investigative services to the leading participants in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Customers rely on us to analyse more than $150bn of their transactions every month, and include cryptocurrency businesses, major financial institutions, and federal government agencies.

We have offices in London, UK, New York City, Singapore and Tokyo. We are backed by SBI Group, Albion VC, Octopus Ventures, SignalFire, Paladin Capital, Santander InnoVentures, and Digital Currency Group.

Requirements

You will be a good fit here if you
Know the basics of cryptocurrencies and have a genuine interest in understanding what patterns lie beneath the seemingly disorderly structure of the blockchain.
Love coding and appreciates the importance of applying good software engineering practices but at the same time you do not strive for perfect, clean code at the cost of effective research.
Love interrogating data, looking for answers to your questions with an eye for what is most useful for the team and for the company’s objectives.
Know the fundamentals of data science and are able to produce high-quality research while also understanding that training a deep learning model is not always the optimal solution.
You need to have

An exciting opportunity has arisen for a Data Scientist to join the Cancer Research UK Grand Challenge Project ‘Mutographs’ on a Fixed Term Contract until May 2022 (with the possibility of extension). We are looking for a new team member to help us analyse cancer genomes collected from around the world in this ambitious and high profile project.
Mutographs is a large, international, multidisciplinary project, led by Professor Mike Stratton. The project was funded in 2017 in the first round of Cancer Research UK Grand Challenge projects. The project aims to explain major global differences in cancer incidence, through analysis of cancer samples from 5,000 patients, covering 5 different types of cancer, and collected across 5 continents.
We are approximately half way through this project and are looking for someone to join the team to help us analyse cancer DNA sequence data from Work Package 1 by ‘chaperoning’ data through an existing data analysis pipeline. This role is computer-based and full training by existing team members will be provided.
You will work remotely at least for the remainder of 2020 and likely beyond, depending on Government guidelines. You will be welcomed into a team that has been successfully working from home since March 2020, we have experience with on-boarding people remotely and have regular formal and informal meetings to ensure all members of the team continue to feel engaged and motivated in this exciting project. You will work closely with the Mutographs scientists, bioinformaticians and project manager and informally with a wider team from the Cancer, Ageing and Somatic Mutation Programme at the Sanger Institute.
About you
The position would suit a graduate (or equivalent experience) who is interested in genomics and/or cancer biology, wishes to learn or develop their skills in analysing NGS sequencing data and who enjoys responsibility for their own area of work, but within the nurturing environment of a strong team.
We are looking for a team player and effective communicator who works well with others and can also work independently (once trained) to a high level of detail and diligence. Once trained, the successful applicant will be able to manage their own workload and timing, but with structured weekly reporting to the Mutographs scientist and project manager. This is a computer based role and the core work can be repetitive, however there will be opportunity for variation and regular meetings to break up the day/week. The role does not require coding or software development experience as the analytical pipelines are already in place. You will be required to review analysis results via a web interface, interpreting and making decisions based on visual analysis outputs.
Applications from individuals wishing to work part time are welcome (minimum of 20 hours per week, please give an indication of hours in your covering letter).
Interested candidates may contact the Mutographs project manager, Laura Humphreys (lp5@sanger.ac.uk), for further information.

119,Computer scientist,London,Research Scientist Core Team,-1,"Tractable is one of the top funded AI startups in Europe, working to help accelerate the process of accident & disaster recovery and prevention. To start, we set out five years ago to build an AI visual expert for vehicle damage estimation. We are still not done, but already our AI-powered product is making a mark across three continents and solving real human-level problems.

Why bother? Put simply, by capturing the way an expert reasons over complex visual tasks, we can help produce assessments faster and to a more consistent standard. In doing so, we address the challenges of a world in which there is an increasing rate of natural disasters and accidents, getting people's lives on track quicker and more fairly.

What's more, our belief is that research with true impact comes from deep domain knowledge, but also that by being led by the expert and across different geographies, over time big research challenges which cross different applications and domains are surfaced. And we've only just begun. So if you are a researcher looking for the perfect place to be challenged daily by real research problems, but which have the potential to have a big impact on the broader world, come join us.

What kind of problems will you be solving?


Our AI looks at photos of damage incurred during car accidents, and is able to assess the full extent of damage to the vehicle. This involves complex visual reasoning over nested expert tasks over all parts of the car from the panels to the supporting screws, requiring both state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning techniques and expert knowledge to solve. In the core research team, this means working on challenging research problems in areas such as: multi-image and task reasoning, domain adaptation, image segmentation and combined visual / metadata learning.

Where will you have impact?


We are always looking for someone to bring new perspectives to the team, with a strong interest in creative problem solving and taking on some of the toughest applied research challenges from a multitude of different angles, all towards the end goal of creating an AI visual expert.

Our approach is collaborative, and through working with others on the team and also using direct input from our customers, you will help to expand the reach and scope of our ML solution, working on the underlying tech that will drive step-changes in what we can offer our customers in our AI-first products.

As a Research Scientist on the core team, you will:
Work on novel solutions to some of the biggest applied research challenges in expert visual reasoning and intelligence which form the foundation of our technology
Design, implement and evaluate models combining rich visual and metadata cues to achieve this
Communicate the work of the research team both internally and externally and engage in collaborations to bring the team's work to product
Requirements:
PhD degree in Computer Science (or related quantitative field) or MS degree in Computer Science with equivalent practical experience
Proven track-record of solving complex problems with machine learning and computer vision
Passionate about bringing impact to the world through ML / CV

At Deliveroo we have a world class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.

Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.

Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.

Our data scientists come from many disciplines including mathematics, statistics, economics/econometrics, physics, psychology, finance, computer science, operations research, cognitive neuroscience and engineering. Some are formally trained in data science, some are not. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

About the role

In this role, you will be designing and building the algorithmic and machine-learning systems that power Deliveroo. You will be working in a cross-functional team alongside engineers, data scientists specialized in algorithms and inference, and product managers to develop systems that make automated decisions at massive scale. Your team has a high degree of autonomy and works at some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants.

We evaluate the performance of all our decision making machines via robust experimentation, usually through our world class experimentation platform.

We are looking for a senior data scientist from an algorithms background, to build intelligent decision making machines. These machines may:
Optimise our delivery network by making rider assignment decisions; predicting how long a leg of the delivery journey will take; or mitigating real time delays
Work out how many riders we need in a particular place at a particular time
Optimise consumer and rider fees
Optimise the consumer experience by showing the most relevant restaurants and dishes
Detect fraud and abuse from consumers, riders, and restaurants
Assist restaurants in optimising their presence on Deliveroo, for example by recommending that they improve their menus or photography, or add a popular dish
Create an ML platform to improve our ML and optimisation capabilities
Requirements:
You are someone who knows the fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research and knows when they should be applied.
You are a keen problem solver, able to think deeply about a business problem and devise a well-thought-out and pragmatic algorithmic solution. And you get satisfaction from seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.
Significant experience building intelligent decision making machines in industry.
Significant experience with end to end productionisation of these models
Ability to take a fuzzy business objective and turn it into a problem that can be solved via machine learning and optimisation, in particular experience in selecting business-appropriate objective functions
Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences
Experience creating new decision making machines from scratch, and designing and building MVPs that quickly get results
Experience mentoring junior colleagues
A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact
Data Science at Deliveroo

We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.",3.5,"Deliveroo

Path Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy policy and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

146,Computer scientist,London,"Post-doctoral Training Fellow, Single Cell Computational Genomics - Functional Genomics team",-1,"The Breast Cancer Now Toby Robins Research Centre at the ICR is the first centre in the UK entirely devoted to breast cancer research. Our goal is to advance research into the causes, diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. It is located in state-of-the-art laboratory space, with excellent core facilities and funding.

The Functional Genomics laboratory headed by Dr. Rachael Natrajan is a multidisciplinary laboratory with the mission to develop new treatment strategies for breast cancers resistant to standard of care therapies.The lab uses state of the art molecular profiling such as single cell sequencing and spatial genomic profiling on patient samples throughout disease progression to understand the molecular evolution of breast cancer and response to targeted therapies. Together with molecular barcoding strategies in patient derived models, mechanistic hypotheses are evaluated in vitro and in vivo and candidate biomarkers or therapeutic options are tested pre-clinically that informs the design of proof of concept clinical trials or drug discovery programmes. We have made novel advances into the understanding of genomic alterations and their impact on breast cancer in different contexts and how to target these effectively (including Maguire et al J. of Pathology 2015, PMID 25424858; Bajrami et al Cancer Res 2014, PMID: 24240700; Natrajan et al PLOS Medicine 2015).

The Bioinformatics Team uses statistical and machine learning approaches to analyse/ interpret genomics datasets from cancer cells, PDX/PDO models and patient studies. The team pursues hypothesis-driven research as well as data-mining of public cancer datasets to generate new hypothesis, which are subsequently tested in collaboration with the wet-lab scientists in the division. Our work has led to significant advances in both bioinformatics and understanding of breast cancer (including Haider et al. JCO PO 2020, DOI: 10.1200/PO.20.00016; Haider et al. Nat. Comms. 2018, PMID 30420699; Baxter et al. Nat. Comms. 2018, PMID 29531215). We are equipped with both freely available and in-house developed software and pipelines supporting our computational needs. Much of the computational work is carried out at the ICR’s High Performance Compute Cluster.
We are seeking a post-doctoral training fellow analytical scientist with experience in single cell bioinformatics to join the Breast Cancer Research Functional Genomics and Bioinformatics Groups. Our goal is to use single cell sequencing approaches to investigate the sub-clonal make up of treatment resistant breast cancers in order to identify new molecular markers and targetable pathways of breast cancer. Results will be validated by wet lab members within the team.
You will work as part of a team of inter-disciplinary data scientists who are experts in single cell genomic analysis, NGS-data analysis, machine learning and software development; and therefore offering unique learning opportunities. Your work will focus on the development and validation of hypotheses, dissecting genetic/genomic and transcriptomic assays to delineate driver genes and pathways of breast cancer. The work will include application of existing tools using in-house and publicly available datasets. These datasets will require strong analytical skills to perform integrated analysis and visualisation of complex multi-omic datasets. You will have opportunities to create/optimise computational pipelines and develop new methods for the analysis and interpretation of big data in breast cancer. You will work closely with experimental biologists and hence it is essential to be able to communicate your findings effectively to biologists and clinicians.

The postholder will work independently and as a part of a multi-disciplinary team of wet lab scientists and analytical scientists, to identify cancer causing aberrations and molecular markers using single cell and spatial genomic profiling of clinical samples and model systems and integrate these with in-house and publicly available high-throughput sequencing and clinical datasets. The identified targets will be used to guide clinical trials at the Breast Cancer Now Centre (ICR). The successful post holder will be involved in the design, analysis, interpretation and scientific writing of results for high impact journals.
Applicants should hold a PhD in bioinformatics/biostatistics/ computational biology, have experience in statistical programming and scripting, experience in analysis of next-generation sequencing data and must have a basic knowledge of biology.

This position is offered on a fixed term 18 month contract. Starting salary is in the range of £32,844* to £38,607 per annum inclusive based on previous postdoctoral experience.

186,Computer scientist,London,Quantum Machine Learning Scientist,-1,"Cambridge Quantum Computing (CQC), is dedicated to developing and deploying advanced scientific research to lead us into the quantum age. CQC’s mission is to develop the world’s best quantum-based products and to make meaningful impacts on humanity.

Quantum machine learning (QML) is one of the most interesting applications of quantum computers. For example, parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) can be trained to perform tasks such as classification, regression, and generative modelling (see our recent Topical Review [1] for an introduction).

QML algorithms can be successfully implemented using hybrid quantum-classical systems and are amongst the most promising techniques to show a near-term impact on real-world problems. Firstly, it has been empirically shown that they can cope with noise, a limited number of quantum bits, and shallow circuits. Secondly, it has been theoretically shown that some classes of circuits have remarkable expressive power and share many aspects with classical neural network models. Also, QML borrows many concepts with Deep Learning and other areas of statistical learning and these links have not been thoroughly explored; in this respect, it offers great opportunities to Machine Learning experts interested in quantum computing applications.

The field is thriving with new ideas and open questions such as proving quantum advantage, assessing computational complexity, designing variational circuits, and efficient state preparation, to name a few.

CQC is looking to expand its cutting-edge Machine Learning and Quantum Algorithms team with a full-time research lead. The role entails contributing to world-class scientific research on quantum algorithms for supervised [2] and unsupervised [3] learning. We are also looking to expand our research portfolio in directions that can demonstrate the impact of PQC on computational techniques with business applications. The research will be both theoretical and aimed at prototyping and benchmarking new algorithms on the state-of-the-art of quantum computers.

This position is embedded in a team of world-class academics focusing on hybrid quantum algorithms for near term application, such as combinatorial optimization and Monte Carlo sampling, in partnership with some of the global leaders in the financial, manufacturing, chemical and shipping industries.

Diamond Light Source is the UK’s national synchrotron; a huge scientific facility designed to produce very intense beams of X-rays, infrared and ultraviolet light. Our scientists use the light to study a vast range of subject matter, from new medicines and treatments for disease to innovative engineering and cutting-edge technology.
Diamond is one of the most advanced scientific facilities in the world, and its pioneering capabilities and talented staff are helping to keep the UK at the forefront of scientific research.
About the Role
You will contribute directly to the delivery of scientific results in one of the most important areas of research for Diamond, macromolecular crystallography. You will join a team of scientists and engineers who develop world-leading tools and algorithms [1, 2] as well as the open-source infrastructure which underpins the near real-time delivery of pertinent scientific results to our users.
Tightly integrated data analysis is essential to provide users with real-time feedback on the outcomes of experiments. A critical component of Diamond’s data analysis software stack is Zocalo [3, 4] which forms the communication layer between data acquisition, data management and data analysis, and manages the workload of data analysis tasks on our clusters. Your role will be to develop this further, with a focus on macromolecular crystallography but also expanding the system to support other techniques and experiment types. This will involve working closely with scientists, methods developers and data acquisition engineers to define requirements and implement pragmatic solutions to challenges as they arise. While this software is primarily developed in-house for our own needs, where possible, future developments should be made with a view to facilitating its use by other facilities.
As a member of the data analysis group you will be working alongside a bright and motivated team in an open and collaborative environment, also working closely with beamline staff, support groups and international collaborators.

To thrive in this role you will be self-driven and given the freedom to learn, but you will also give direction and explore your own solutions to all these challenges.

In summary, you will:

Research and design new cryptography applications with a quantum advantage, together with their security proofs.
Find innovative solutions to the problems faced by classical cryptography in a quantum world and to the challenges faced in quantum cryptography.

Develop and implement mathematical schemes and algorithms, e.g. randomness extractors, digital signatures and other cryptographic primitives.
