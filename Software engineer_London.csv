The interesting stuff…
You will have spent lots of quality time with your IDE of choice, learning the powerful idioms and important idiosyncrasies of at least one programming language. We like to code mostly in Golang, Python, Node.js / JavaScript, .NET Core and Perl here, but we’re open to all.
You regularly practice honing your engineering craft, expanding your skills in techniques such as TDD, refactoring, clean code and pair programming.
You will ideally be familiar with AWS, although it’s useful if you have some knowledge of other cloud services, too.
You appreciate the benefits of CI pipelines and automation for both quality and deployment.
You understand the importance of delighting users with your product while making sure it remains stable, performant, observable and supportable.
Why Zoopla…
We're serious about tech but we don't take ourselves too seriously.
We are spiritually agile, not religiously agile.
We strongly believe in the value of good design. We believe it is a primary differentiator in an increasingly crowded marketplace.
We believe in the value of data. We run a team that is data informed. We think being data-driven is soulless and dangerous. Clean, confident, clear data combined with the insights of the team is what drives our decisions.
We want to build small, collaborative, cross-functional teams that push each other to create elegant, simple solutions to difficult customer problems.
No matter what the role we want everyone to be obsessed with getting inside the minds of our customers.
How do you know we’re the best place for you?
You strive to set the standard and are always looking to raise the bar and want to be surrounded by others who do so as well.
You enjoy knowing your customer.
You want to build things together, collaboratively with your team.
You want to own it; to have ownership and accountability for the outcomes of your effort.
You value sharing and committing to discussions and debates with your teammates.
And if you want to come help us re-imagine an industry.",3.7,"Zoopla

11,Software engineer,London,Full-Stack Software Engineer,-1,"While most of Team Bulb are working from home at this time, our Covid-secure offices are open for team members who need to use them. We’ve hired and onboarded more than 150 people virtually during the pandemic and have developed our ways of working to make sure new joiners feel part of our team. This includes virtual socials, lunch time 'Insights' from a range of internal and external speakers, and live streaming whole company meetings. If you'd like to read more about how we've adapted over the last few months, head over to our blog, and you can let us know about your specific requirements as part of the recruitment process.

About the team

Bulb is here to help our members cut their energy bills and reduce their carbon emissions. Our product teams make that happen. We’re developing products that will deliver the future of energy - from using AI to read energy meters, to making carbon offsetting fun and simple, from finding out how to get the most from Smart Meter data to helping people get paid for their solar energy. We also power the sign-up journey that helped us become the fastest growing company in the UK last year and the internal tools that let us deliver an excellent Trust Pilot score.

We work in project-based sprints in integrated teams and encourage an open and transparent working environment.

The following pods are hiring Full-Stack Engineers:

Smart

Own end to end technology behind Smart meter experience - installation, onboarding, data consumption, and energy usage advice. Integration with smart home appliances is likely the future as well.

Innovation
Solar: Developing new tools and features to help members with solar panels to save money and get paid for the energy that the export to the grid.
EV charging: helping members with Electric Vehicles save and reduce their carbon emissions by charging at the cheapest and greenest times of day. Investigating future technologies like vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid (i.e. using your car battery to store extra renewable energy to use later).
Batteries: Helping members with solar panels store excess solar energy for use when the sun has gone down.
Requirements

At Bulb we want to hire people with the experiences necessary to get going quickly, but who are also interested in learning new things and are comfortable working in a changing environment.

* You take pleasure from clear code, see writing tests as an integral part of the development process and understand the benefit of writing code and tests in small increments.

* You are keen to learn new technologies and have ideas about how we do things better

* You like solving both real world and technical problems

* You are an enthusiastic team player who enjoys collaborating across teams and departments

* You are passionate about learning and personal growth.

The Stack

At Bulb we use a wide variety of technologies. While we have core technologies that we work with, we're always trying to pick the best tool for the job, and are always looking at what's on the horizon.
Our stack currently includes:
Node, Typescript, Koa, React, GraphQL, React Native, Webpack, Babel,
Circle CI, Kubernetes, Docker and Google Cloud Platform
We use Git for source control, write tests and run continuous integration, and review each other’s code through pull requests.

Ideally, you would be familiar with these technologies or similar patterns; notably, Typescript/Javascript coupled with React is a core technology for us. But we’re more interested in your broad experience of software development than of specific tools or libraries. You should be comfortable getting up-to-speed quickly in new tools and platforms. You should be pragmatic and experienced enough to know when a different choice of technology would be more suitable, and comfortable leading explorations into new technologies.

Team Structure

Teams at Bulb are cross-functional, self-organized and autonomous pods.
You’ll be working within a growing cross functional team composed of specialists with backgrounds in DevOps, Engineering and Security.
We practice Scrum/Kanban and work lean.
Work is not siloed, you’re able to commit across the stack, and you have a view of all the features the teams are working on.
We use data to drive continuous improvement in our development process and we review this data in our fortnightly retrospectives.

Software Engineer interview process
We do an initial competency interview which consists of some screening questions, like checking your right to work in the UK (unfortunately we can’t sponsor visas), and your experience in our hiring competencies.

This first interview has two purposes: it's a chance for you to ask questions about how we work, and for us to find out what you're looking for from your next role.

We'll also be interested to find out more about your curiosity, initiative, technical, communication and teamwork skills. So we'll be interested to talk about things like: your approach to dealing with difficult situations like dealing with conflicting or ambiguous requirements, how you communicate your work with others and how you learn new things and teach others.

The final stage interview consists of a half-day of interviews, where you’ll do a conversational technical interview and a pairing session with one of our engineers. You don’t need to prepare anything & there’s no take-home portion of the interview process.

How we assess candidates
We use a set of competencies to evaluate candidates throughout the interview process: communication, initiative, teamwork, curiosity and technical skill. You can read more about these in our blog post about our hiring framework.

You are able to profile software running on GPUs, using appropriate tools and techniques to find performance issues & bottlenecks.
You use and modify compiler infrastructure (such as NVCC, LLVM, MLIR, XLA) to improve performance on hardware accelerators. You might have experience using these tools or extending and modifying them.
You might have experience writing distributed GPU applications, using NCCL2, NCCL or MPI, and debugging performance issues with such applications.
You take the initiative and assume responsibility for solving technical problems. You can drive multiple stages of software projects - from requirements gatherings to launch and validation. You often look for what can be improved and you have a proactive attitude in helping our researchers.
You work well within teams. You have worked on multi-person software projects and/or on open source projects. You participate in technical discussions, ask insightful questions, and work with the team to pull together scoping, schedules, and solutions to issues.
You are a good communicator. You know how to document software and standard methodologies. You clearly and effectively communicate your ideas, your work, and your results to team members, team leaders and senior managers.
You have an interest in our mission and AI / Machine Learning.
Qualities that are an asset
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, a related technical field, or equivalent practical experience.
Experience with programming in C/C++.
Experience with coding GPUs (CUDA).
Experience with large distributed systems and NCCL or MPI.
Experience with debugging GPU performance issues.
Experience in parallel programming and high-performance computing.
Familiarity with Python.
Interest in AI and basic knowledge of AI algorithms.
What we offer
You will join a diverse and vibrant environment where you can influence and have impact on groundbreaking research results. You will enjoy a creative and stimulating work environment and direct access to world-class researchers!
We constantly iterate on our work environment. It has been crafted to help you lead a balanced life. This goes from providing you excellent facilities (healthy food, music rooms, gym, faith rooms, terraces, spacious desks, etc) to enabling your manager to make special work arrangements if you need them. Our managers are being supported by our People and Culture team to ensure we do our best to suit your needs. We provide baby bonding leaves for both parents. Our list of arrangements is pretty extensive, so please do discuss this throughout the process.

Upgrading the entire planet to a new financial system is a challenge of epic proportions. Like the first moon landing, it requires a special kind of people working together with unusual skill, focus and determination. We're changing the financial landscape, and to do so, well we need the best team on board for our mission. In short, to achieve our goals, we need rockstars. As simple as that.

A little about us:
We make it safe and easy to buy, store and learn about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
We currently have over 5 million customers across 40 countries.
We're part of the Digital Currency Group, a group of companies driving progress in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space that includes Grayscale, Genesis, Coindesk and Foundry Services.

Design, build and maintain advanced applications services.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design, and ship new features.
Write testable, maintainable code for robustness and reliability.
Work on bug fixing and improving application performance.
Write code that directly affects users, the company and the Bitcoin ecosystem.
The ideal candidate for this role will have:
A passion for blockchain and cryptocurrencies (this is a new industry so we'll help you learn about how the blockchain works and the technicals).
A proven background in computer science in areas such as algorithms, data structures, and software design.
Extensive programming experience in at least one language such as Go, Java, C++, C#, Python, etc.
A continuous improvement mindset.
BSc/MSc/PhD in computer science or other technical discipline, or equivalent working experience
A passion for software development, mobile technology and Bitcoin
To be friendly, transparent, articulate and driven to succeed
A work permit for the UK if you are not a British citizen
Don't be put off if you don't tick all of the boxes – they're a guide based on what we'd love to see but we appreciate that excellent software engineers have diverse backgrounds.

Remote Life at Luno


If you're looking to work on something truly global and disruptive with a forward-thinking and ambitious team that highly values diversity, teamwork, and the continuous quest for excellence, then this is an opportunity for you.

Like the majority of the companies, Luno is currently working remotely to keep our employees safe, which means you will not be physically, but virtually onboarded for now!
Live long and prosper. We've got you covered with excellent private medical insurance.
Generous maternity / paternity and even (yes, you are reading it correctly) paw-ternity for your furry friend..
Annual Inspiration Day.. like that pottery course you've always been meaning to do!
Work with a diverse team of hardworking, ambitious and friendly people on something that will truly revolutionise the financial world.
We are a social bunch of people, we have virtual quarterly activities and drinks Fridays for whoever wants to join!
We have virtual cooking, dancing, drawing and house planting classes hosted by our Lunauts Monthly to break up your day and work that other part of your brain.
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

47,Software engineer,London,Software Engineer (Support Content),-1,"Communication has changed for people. It's changed for businesses, too.


Intercom is the only suite of customer messaging products that drives growth at every stage of the customer lifecycle—across acquisition, engagement, and support. Today more than 30,000 businesses use Intercom to connect with a billion people worldwide.

Join the company helping businesses grow revenue through live chat, and so much more.

What's the Opportunity?


Intercom has built a centre for our world leading support product in London. We are looking for a Product Engineer to join our Support Content team and help us build on our previous successes. This team is responsible for our Help Center Articles product along with the content our customers create, manage and serve to their users. Team Support Content is at the centre of our mission to make business personal, helping our customers scale so their staff can focus on the questions only a human can handle. These products help thousands of people a day, getting them the answers they need around the clock.

This is more than a technical role, you'll be a creative product and technical contributor. You'll use your experience to inform our engineering process and decisions when building new features and ensuring scalability and availability of the entire platform.

You'll be part of one of our product teams which are multidisciplinary with design, frontend and backend engineering combined. While specialisation is important, we discourage pigeonholing. Our most effective people work across design and implementation, making the right technology decisions to build the best product.

One of our senior engineers, joining from a major PaaS provider, described his experience as ""Before, I saw customers through a very large telescope. Now I'm right beside them."" We love the satisfaction of hearing how happy our customers are with what we build for them.

Learn more about our engineering culture at intercom.engineering

What will I be doing?


As a Product Engineer you will:
Contribute to our technical architecture as we grow. We scale to service requests from all our customers' customers. We're growing and so are they.
Care about agility as much you care for scalability and availability. Continuous deployment keeps us focused on incremental releases. Even our biggest technical achievements roll out piece by piece, feature flagged out of sight. Projects are kept short and tightly scoped. Teams build a weekly cadence of releases
Ship a change to production on your first day and a significant public release in your first week. That ""day one"" change is automatically deployed to production along with 100 other deployments (on average) each weekday
Be proud of what you work on, obsess about the quality of the work you produce. Join us to do the best work of your career.
What qualifications do I need?


Typically, a degree level qualification but at least NQF Level 6 (or similar)

What skills do I need?
Ideally, you've built an exciting SaaS product in your previous roles and loved the satisfaction that comes with knowing that people around the world are using something you've created
You can demonstrate significant impact that your work has had on the product and/or the team
You also need to have deep knowledge of a high-level programming language (for example, Ruby, Python, Perl etc.) but it doesn't need to be a language that we use here! Great people are effective and learn what we use quickly (or introduce us to better ways of working)
You will have experience with Distributed systems
Where will I be working?


This role is based in London but in line with our COVID guidelines, candidates can work from home anywhere in the UK and will not be required in the London office through to June 2021. Intercom will support new candidates with an initial work-from-home stipend and an ongoing monthly stipend.

What happens when I apply?


First, apply so we can review your CV :) As the next step, we will send you our take home test to work on in your own time. The following step will be a phone interview with one of our engineers which will focus on technical and culture contribution questions (this step is sometimes broken down into 2 interviews). The final step is a virtual onsite interview with our London team.

Our Senior Engineers are crazy about software, have expertise in solving a wide range of problems from monoliths to microservices, learn from and coach their colleagues, and constantly strive to be nice humans.
What does the job entail?
We primarily write and deliver custom software to our customers. We build solutions in a variety of languages and platforms, historically Ruby on Rails, we tend to use React, JavaScript, Elixir, and Clojure these days. We will usually be responsible for setting up a customer’s infrastructure on AWS with tools like Ansible and Terraform though sometimes we opt for a Platform as a Service like Heroku. We make sure there is a Continuous Delivery pipeline running our automated test suites before deploying changes.
Senior Engineers are responsible for ensuring the technical quality of our deliveries, introducing new technologies and techniques to the business, as well as coaching their colleagues.
The software we build solves business problems. We’ve built software for karaoke, e-commerce, retail buying departments, accountants, photography studios, warehouses, supply chain companies, and ourselves. Typical projects will last 3-6 months, some customers work with us over longer periods but we like to mix up teams at around 6 months to keep things fresh.
What experience are we looking for?
We’ll expect you to be a polyglot programmer versed in a mix of object and functional programming languages. We’d expect you to have some blog posts about your discipline, perhaps even a talk or two. Not only this but the right person would be adept in sharing their knowledge with others – we’d love to hear some examples of coaching and growing team members.
Further required experience:
Working directly with customers
Writing code with Test Driven Development
Pair programming as we pair around 50% of the time
Agile practices such as Scrum, XP, and/or Kanban
Working with a range of SQL and NoSQL databases
Infrastructure as code tools such as Ansible, Chef, Puppet, and/or Saltstack
Debugging a range of applications
Experience debugging infrastructure (AWS/Heroku/Linux/HTTP)
Everything else is optional but highly sought after. We would love you to have experience in:
Writing code with Acceptance Test Driven Development
Component based design techniques such as using pattern libraries, styled components, CSS-in-JS, BEM, and/or SUIT CSS
The React ecosystem including a TDD approach
Strong delivery skills: a huge drive to get something shipped
What is it like to work at Made Tech?
We are a sanctuary for those wanting to hone their skills alongside like-minded learners. After joining our team it is common for new starters to comment on how much they’re learning and how much they enjoy the fact they are surrounded by people they can learn from. This includes our most senior hires.
The biggest thing you’ll take away from our culture after spending the day with us would be that we practice continuous improvement at every level. Everyone has peer-based one-to-ones every 2 weeks, along with monthly one-to-ones with a director. Teams have fortnightly retrospectives. We also hold a company wide retrospective fortnightly. We discuss our problems out in the open, and rather than punish failure we band together to find solutions.
Other notable things:
Every Friday afternoon is dedicated to learning new skills
Unlimited holiday
Everyone is encouraged to write blog posts regularly
Our handbook is open sourced
We are vegan and non-drinker friendly as well as meat-eater and drinker friendly
Retreats and trips every year

We're always hiring software engineers for all three of our offices. Technology is at the core of how we approach that work and engineers are intimately tied in to every area of the business.

We are big believers in functional programming, using OCaml, a statically-typed functional programming language, as our primary development language. We also believe in the value of open source software, using it in our daily work and releasing hundreds of thousands of lines of our own code as open source.

About You
Top-notch programming skills.
Deep experience with—and love for—technology. There’s no specific checklist; we use software to approach a variety of problems, so we’re interested in everything from machine learning to systems administration to programming language design.
Strong interpersonal skills. Software engineering at Jane Street is highly collaborative, and we are looking for people who can work effectively in small, close-knit teams.
We don’t expect you to have experience with functional programming, OCaml, or finance; we’re happy to hire talented engineers and teach them what they need to know.

Company Overview

Our Purpose

To make a more open land market to empower the next generation of property developers to build the homes (& places) we need for an ever growing and diverse population

“Like all great tech companies, we started with a problem.

Andrew (an east-London, quasi-hipster software engineer) wanted to build a house. And I (Jonny, a Geordie, ex-town planner turned software developer) knew the pain of the property industry systems he’d need to use to build that house.

We both knew that fixing those systems – making it easier to access that data – would help a whole load of people.

And thus LandTech was born – an ecosystem helping to make the entire house building process more efficient.

We started with LandInsight, the hugely successful (and multi-award-winning) site-sourcing platform. Then we added LandEnhance to help get planning permission, and LandFund to help secure funding.

But, not content to just be the fastest-growing PropTech company in the UK, we’re now heading international. Because all those problems we’re fixing aren’t just UK problems – they’re worldwide.

We’re helping to build more houses. Better houses. Plus the roads, schools, hospitals, and gyms to go with them.

Help us make that happen” - CEO/Co-Founder, Jonny Britton

Some achievements & awards so far:
Top 10 SaaS Companies to work for - Sales Confidence, 2018 & 2019
Excellence in People Development - PropTech, 2018

You'll support the team in developing our products and re-designing our platform for scale from a single region to multiple regions over the next 12 months.
You'll contribute towards our engineering culture, improving your own craft and those around you as part of continuous learning.
You'll be accountable for:
Delivering customer and business value, often, repeatedly and sustainably.
Collaborating closely, supporting those around you.
Helping understand problems and collaboratively providing high quality solutions to those problems.
Writing clean, concise, high quality code that others can understand and work with.

Empathising with users and colleagues to understand the problems they face
Understanding, importing and connecting datasets as part of our product... fast, automated, repeatedly.
Building systems for storing and accessing our data, moving it to where it needs to be, easily.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer, you'll contribute high-quality code to Palantir Gotham or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed at the most important institutions across the public and private sectors. You'll build features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world.

Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers, each focusing on a specific aspect of a product. For example, you might be part of a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage movement among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product.

Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle - from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution, and shipping. As a Software Engineer, you'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them. We think the best way to understand what our users need is to meet them, so occasionally you'll tour the assembly line at an auto manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and their pain points.

SWE principles include:

• Dedication: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.
• Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other Product Managers, Designers and Product Reliability Engineers. We also partners with our business development teams (Forward Deployed Engineers, Deployment Strategists) in order to understand and solve our customers' problems.
• Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities, and don't micromanage. We want to give people the space to think for themselves.

Technologies We Use

It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers who bring diverse experience — startup founders, industry veterans, university TAs, and more — you'll build your skillset to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use:

• A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front end
• Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and Redux
• Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github
Requirements
Strong engineering background in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, and Physics.
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.
Strong coding skills with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages.
Ability to collaborate and empathize with a variety of individuals. You can iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how your technical decisions impact them.
Demonstrated ability to learn and work independently and make decisions with minimal supervision.

Delicious recipes, precise ingredients & a dollop of adventure, delivered to your door. We have invested into our technology, data capability and our product to ensure the customer is at the heart of what we do. Every aspect of our business is powered by our passion.

Whether it is innovation through our recipe development, building algorithms to optimise our recipe box journey or devising strategies to reduce plastic and food waste. All our teams play a part in our amazing growth in the UK!

Our DREAM? To be the most-loved way to eat dinner, and for every meal to leave the planet better off. Gousto is changing how people shop, cook and eat food at home. It’s an incredibly exciting time to join our team!

The Opportunity

The code we write powers every aspect of our business from the menu recommendation engine to driving our supply chain. We are a scale up business on a steep growth trajectory, and with that comes the need to build a platform that can scale. In parallel to this, we need to expand our team, evolving effective tools and processes that ensure we can continue to deliver quality code at pace.

Our platform is entirely cloud-based, and many of our backend services are now delivered via AWS Lambda. Our continuous delivery pipeline is fully automated and we release code to production multiple times a day. We’re in the process of moving our microservices architecture to containers.

Your skills and experience will help us move to the next level. We know we’ve got lots of things right but we also have many things still to improve. Right now we’re working on creating robust seed data for testing and flexible developer environments for coding.

We are making huge investments in technology, and plan to triple the size of our team to over 200 people in the next few years. As well as providing lots of career growth for our team, there will be plenty of opportunities to lead, mentor, influence and learn.

What’s it really like to work here?
We are customer-centric, data driven and outcome focused, using lean principles to work iteratively, experiment and learn fast.
We work in cross-functional squads which we are slowly evolving to include business partners. This allows us to work more closely with our colleagues in food, operations and marketing, enabling greater alignment, collaboration and innovation.
Our squads have a high level of autonomy to decide both what outcomes they should pursue and how they will achieve them.
We believe in being agile rather than committing to a single framework. We have a set of lean and agile principles which we follow, but beyond that squads are empowered and encouraged to tailor their working processes.
We discourage pigeon-holing which means our engineers are responsible for designing, writing, testing, deploying and maintaining their code in production. We don’t have QAs, and our architect works closely with squads to consult and collaborate.
A devops culture is central to our way of working and our squads are responsible for running their solutions in production.
Pairing and TDD are practices we champion and want to keep improving.
10% of our time is dedicated to tech innovation and we hold regular brown bags.
We are committed to being involved in the wider tech community, hosting meetups, speaking at events and sharing learnings via our blog.

Requirements

What skills and experience will you need
Deep knowledge of either PHP/Node or Python
Experience of working on scalable, distributed, cloud-based systems
Working with async and event driven architectures
Experience of CI/CD tooling and responsibly running solutions in production, working with logging, monitoring and alerting stacks
A knowledge of lean product development and the build, measure, learn loop
What we look for in a great Software Engineer

Great engineering - and this is so much more than writing great code. As well as good software craftsmanship practices, you value thorough test coverage. You’ll know the fundamentals of great design and have experience of maintaining your code in production.

Collaboration - we firmly believe that software is a team sport and that effective, quality solutions are delivered quickly when teams work together.

Ownership - agility only works with accountability. We believe in empowering teams, and hand in hand with that we expect teams a strong sense of responsibility and commitment from our teams.

Lean delivery - you value agility as much as you value great code. You deliver in small batches to reduce risk and create a fast feedback loop. You have a continuous improvement mindset, constantly seeking to improve your team’s processes.

Growth mindset - you are curious and are always looking to learn. You value feedback as a learning tool, and you offer constructive feedback to help your teammates improve.

At White Swan Data we decide what is worth betting on. The technology at the heart of our business produces consistent and significant returns for our clients. We are a small but rapidly growing team of mathematicians, data scientists and software engineers constantly striving to refine our world class betting models while also researching and deploying new ones.

Our work bridges three domains, each challenging in its own right: betting and gambling, quantitative research, and software development. The nature of our work and the relative immaturity of modern betting markets means opportunities to exploit are not in short supply. But people with sufficient skill and versatility to attack these projects are hard to find! So, we are always looking for talented, motivated and organised people.

About this Role

We have experienced rapid growth in the last couple of years and systems which made sense held together by spreadsheets and R scripts are now in need of review and rebuild using RDBMS and application programming languages. So we are hiring a team of software engineers to work alongside our quants and data analysts to build a modern software backend to power our betting analysis and strategies.

The system is for inhouse use and so is mostly backend, with only as much frontend as necessary to keep the quants happy. You will be working in small teams of around 2-8 including quants and developers and it’s essentially a greenfield opportunity where you will have a big say in how it gets done. Although we are trying to firm up our stack around Python, Kotlin, PostgreSQL and Google Cloud we are not fanatics (but Kotlin is pretty nice).

If you are an ambitious, skilled and maybe just a little bit bored software engineer looking to build a modern system to facilitate data gathering, bet placement, data analysis and systems automation inside a smallish (60 people) company where the CEO is also a developer then this is the role for you!

Requirements
At least 5 years of commercial software engineering experience.
At least 3 years exposure to a modern statically typed application languages such as Scala, Kotlin, Java, C#, F#, Dart, Swift.
Python and/or R would be a plus.
Strong SQL/RDBMS (such as PostgreSQL or MySQL) experience.
Experience deploying and monitoring services on modern cloud platforms, including infrastructure as code and continuous deployment.
Experience with asynchronous networking and IO.
Exposure to continuous integration and maintaining high coverage test suites.
Experience in SOA/RPC frameworks such as gRPC, Thrift, GraphQL and OpenAPI.
Very strong attention to detail - our systems should not leak.
Software Engineering or Computer Science degree.
Responsibilities
Comprehend the teams existing systems and processes.
Create your own specifications by interviewing our subject matter experts..
Design and build new systems for automating data collection, data analysis and betting API interaction etc.
Collaborate with the team’s quants and software engineers to ensure timely releases and maximize system uptime.

You will become proficient with our domain by learning from your team and the wider business to
understand the mortgage market and the technology that underpins how we set people free from
the hell of mortgages. You will help shape the product and the work you and your teammates will
deliver by working alongside your stakeholders and our engineering leads.

Our engineers work in cross-functional crews typically comprising 7 to 8 people including product
owners, designers and contributors who are empowered to meet their goals. We seek to give all our
crews the resources and support they need with a minimum of constraints.

You have a delivery focussed mindset and make use of agile software development practices to
ensure your crew’s success. We value collaboration, repeatability and continuous improvement.

We look for people who love to learn new things whilst using their existing skills and experience to
enrich the engineering team.

More about what you’ll do:

• Contributing to the continued development of our codebase using a broad range of technologies across our entire stack by writing well formed and properly documented code.
• Adding to our culture of automated testing and specification, through well-designed strongly-typed interfaces, property testing or end-to-end integration and system tests.
• Helping us to improve our culture of automated testing and specification.
• Collaborating with your crew’s stakeholders and product managers to help shape the work that the crew undertakes.
• Working closely with non-technical crew members to focus on building systems that directly serve our customers and to ensure we are always building better things.
• Helping the team to operate effectively by breaking problems down into simpler and faster to build components.

We use lots of exciting technology

We value well architected solutions with reliable and maintainable code using the right software
engineering principles above all else. Our engineers want to deliver the best possible solution they
can and you will play a key role in ensuring our continued success in doing so.

We’re big believers in using the right tools for the job to build the best software. Right now we
mainly make use of functional programming, but are always evaluating our tools. Experience with
functional programming or understanding of the functional programming principles is required for
this role.

Our existing systems make heavy use of Haskell, PureScript and Typescript, Bazel and Nix as well as
PostgreSQL. We deploy and operate our software using Docker and Kubernetes in AWS.

We believe in learning and development

Our engineers come from a number of backgrounds. We have self-taught team members working
with graduates from universities and bootcamps alike. Some of us have worked in large corporations
while some of us have only ever known startups. A portion of the team consistently enjoy full-stack
work, others prefer to specialise in certain areas. While your role and crew might see you targeting
certain areas of work, we see this only as a specialism. You can expect to be exposed to many other
parts of our codebase and to learn about and participate in its development while growing your own
fundamental engineering skills. From weekly talks and reading groups to sponsored meet-ups and
conference attendance, we want to help take our engineers to the next level.

We were one of the world's first ""RegTechs"" and we're shaking up an entire industry. Our client's love what we do (Net Promoter Scores of over 50) and this has lead to phenomenal and consistent revenue growth.

Our first area of focus was to help managers with Shareholding Disclosure, a complex regulatory problem without a decent solution in the market. We were first to licence legal information from aosphere, an affiliate of Allen & Overy, which underpins some of our rule packages.

Since that time, our product has become the undisputed market leader for the management of Shareholding Disclosure. We have also added new ground-breaking services - Sensitive Industries and Position Limits - and in 2020, have introduced Rapportr to make reporting simple for our clients.

Rapptr, our main product, isn't some shiny but vacant consumer app. There's real complexity both in terms of volumes of data that we deal with, and how we visualise the results of hundreds of rules running across thousands of portfolios - in a way that's simple, understandable and easy to manage.

We're a small team of smart, friendly people who collaborate closely and take pride in delivering amazing software and providing extraordinary customer support. You’ll help shape what we work on and how we do it. You won’t be micro-managed or stuck in a rut. We work hard on challenging problems and have a good time doing it.

Our team values are professionalism, sustainability, and psychological safety; we hold each other to high standards, give each other considered, caring feedback, work smart and look out for each other.

We want to help small businesses win. That’s why we’re here.

We connect small business owners to investors – to create jobs, help families and power economies – because we believe that people are made to do more. And we want to help them.

So, we created the leading online marketplace for small business loans. Our investors have lent £8.1 billion in 110,000 loans to 77,000 small business owners. In a single year, we unlocked 115,000 jobs and contributed £6.5 billion to the global economy. There’s never been a better time to join!

Be part of the team that changes everything. Let’s build the place where small businesses can get the funding they need to win and leave a legacy behind, forever.

This role sits within the “Tech” team. The drivers behind our platform – brilliant people working together to create, code, and build the next game changers.

About the team

The driving force behind the world’s leading platform for small business lending is our engineering team. We are a diverse group from more than 25 different countries and cultures who bring together a wide range of backgrounds and experience (from music to aerospace engineering).

We are focused entirely on using technology to provide the best experience for our borrowers and investors. We are doing this by building elegant, sustainable, and scalable solutions that can be applied globally. We work in small agile teams practicing continuous integration, TDD and are no strangers to pairing as we believe that working together is smarter than sitting in silos.

About the role

Day to Day, this role will include:
Collaborating as part of an agile cross functional team, as well as technology chapters
Building great user experiences for customers
Delivering innovation through software to automate processes that enable Funding Circle to operate at scale
Using Clojure, Kafka, React and Ruby currently and built entirely on AWS
Supporting our production systems
About You

This roles requires someone who has:
Production experience in Clojure
Fundamental programming skills (data structures, algorithms)
Familiarity developing on Unix/Linux
Good communication skills, both written and spoken
Knowledge of Agile, Scrum, BDD, TDD and CI/CD
An interest or experience in any of Functional Programming, Distributed Systems or Event-Driven Architectures
Why join us?

We’re gearing up for our biggest chapter yet – and it’s being driven by everyone.

We think of ourselves as the career launchpad. A place to develop yourself, fast. Real work. Real experience. Real opportunities to collect skills. Think big remits and huge ownership to make great things happen.

Yes, it’s target-driven and high-octane – but we like to play hard too. That’s what makes us, us. Our vibrant culture is built around potential and creating a place where you can really be you. We keep it agile and open. All voices heard. Because we believe great ideas come from everywhere.

If you show skill and are willing, we’ll back you all the way. This is the place for you to build something incredible.

It’s in our differences that we find our strengths.

We celebrate and support the differences that make you, you. So we’re building a culture where difference is valued. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and affirmative action employer. We truly believe diversity makes us better. We particularly encourage applications from applicants from underrepresented backgrounds. We welcome applicants who may want to work flexibly.

You will become proficient with our domain by learning from your team and the wider business to
understand the mortgage market and the technology that underpins how we set people free from
the hell of mortgages. You will help shape the product and the work you and your teammates will
deliver by working alongside your stakeholders and our engineering leads.

Our engineers work in cross-functional crews typically comprising 7 to 8 people including product
owners, designers and contributors who are empowered to meet their goals. We seek to give all our
crews the resources and support they need with a minimum of constraints.

You have a delivery focussed mindset and make use of agile software development practices to
ensure your crew’s success. We value collaboration, repeatability and continuous improvement.

We look for people who love to learn new things whilst using their existing skills and experience to
enrich the engineering team.

More about what you’ll do:

• Contributing to the continued development of our codebase using a broad range of technologies across our entire stack by writing well formed and properly documented code.
• Adding to our culture of automated testing and specification, through well-designed strongly-typed interfaces, property testing or end-to-end integration and system tests.
• Helping us to improve our culture of automated testing and specification.
• Collaborating with your crew’s stakeholders and product managers to help shape the work that the crew undertakes.
• Working closely with non-technical crew members to focus on building systems that directly serve our customers and to ensure we are always building better things.
• Helping the team to operate effectively by breaking problems down into simpler and faster to build components.

We use lots of exciting technology

We value well architected solutions with reliable and maintainable code using the right software
engineering principles above all else. Our engineers want to deliver the best possible solution they
can and you will play a key role in ensuring our continued success in doing so.

We’re big believers in using the right tools for the job to build the best software. Right now we
mainly make use of functional programming, but are always evaluating our tools. Experience with
functional programming or understanding of the functional programming principles is required for
this role.

Our existing systems make heavy use of Haskell, PureScript and Typescript, Bazel and Nix as well as
PostgreSQL. We deploy and operate our software using Docker and Kubernetes in AWS.

We believe in learning and development

Our engineers come from a number of backgrounds. We have self-taught team members working
with graduates from universities and bootcamps alike. Some of us have worked in large corporations
while some of us have only ever known startups. A portion of the team consistently enjoy full-stack
work, others prefer to specialise in certain areas. While your role and crew might see you targeting
certain areas of work, we see this only as a specialism. You can expect to be exposed to many other
parts of our codebase and to learn about and participate in its development while growing your own
fundamental engineering skills. From weekly talks and reading groups to sponsored meet-ups and
conference attendance, we want to help take our engineers to the next level.

Our client's love what we do (Net Promoter Scores of over 50) and this has lead to phenomenal and consistent revenue growth.

Our first area of focus was to help managers with Shareholding Disclosure, a complex regulatory problem without a decent solution in the market. We were first to licence legal information from aosphere, an affiliate of Allen & Overy, which underpins some of our rule packages.

Since that time, our product has become the undisputed market leader for the management of Shareholding Disclosure. We have also added new ground-breaking services - Sensitive Industries and Position Limits - and in 2020, have introduced Rapportr to make reporting simple for our clients.

Rapptr, our main product, isn't some shiny but vacant consumer app. There's real complexity both in terms of volumes of data that we deal with, and how we visualise the results of hundreds of rules running across thousands of portfolios - in a way that's simple, understandable and easy to manage.

UK Employee Benefits
Holiday - It is important to us that you take some time for yourself to do the things you love, recharge and refresh so we offer a holiday allowance of 25 days + bank holidays + Christmas closure (usually 4 days).
Flexible working - We are a fully flexible working company and support people working from home and remotely when travelling - this means you can pretty much work from anywhere and set your own hours. We only ask that you are available for team and client meetings and can dial in from wherever you are if you are working remotely that day.
Travel cards - London travel can be costly so transport to the office is on us! We will provide you with an annual Oyster card for the zone you live in or a monthly travel allowance if you live outside of London and use public transport to get to the office.
Pensions - We want you to feel like working at Formidable is contributing to your future, not just your career, so we will match 4% of your employee contribution with 4% to your pension.
Private medical insurance - We like to do what we can to give our Formidables peace of mind internally and externally so we provide full private MHD [medical history disregarded] cover with AXA PPP, including dental and optician add-ons (this can be extended to spouses and children too and Formidable will pay 75% of their premiums), as well as life cover & critical illness cover.
Home office stipend - Upon joining Formidable as a permanent employee, you will have access to a stipend of £/€1,750 to help provide a comfortable working space at home.
Health & wellness bonus - Health and wellness comes in all different forms so to support you in choosing what works, we give you an annual £1,250 bonus to spend on what is right for you.
Inter-office travel - We like our Formidables to get to know each other properly; what better way than a trip to visit and work with other teams around the globe? We will give you £850 annually to cover your travel and accommodation so you can go and work in one of our other locations and get to know the team better. (Pending COVID-19 restrictions)
Open source - We have incredible access to a wider community of coding experts who are as passionate about Open Source as we are + an internal ‘Sauce Program’ that enables you to earn extra money for any extra OSS hours you put in.
Training & development - You’ll receive unparalleled support from your peers + an all-you-can-eat professional development budget to ensure you can access all that you need to keep growing in your role and levelling up.
Collaboration & exposure - We work in a collaborative environment that leads to continuous, organic personal development. You’ll also have exposure to a wide variety of customers, from scale-ups to Fortune 100s.
Giving back - We also love to give back to our community - so if you give to charity and want to set this up through payroll giving, we will match your contributions by up to £1000 a year.
Feeling peckish? Us too, which is why we have catered team lunches twice a week + a fully stocked office of snacks and drinks to keep you going throughout the day. (Pending COVID-19 restrictions)
Visiting HQ - Formidable was launched in Seattle so once a year we all descend on Formidable HQ for FormidaGathering - it’s quite a week away!
Salary

As a true example of how Formidable believes in equity and transparency, we have an “Open Pay” system that is linked to our career ladder. Depending on experience, the salary for this role would likely sit between £60-85k.

How do we work?

Our consultants act as an extension of our customer’s team, embedding themselves in the environment, and adapting to our clients’ requirements and challenges, so they can develop a truly impactful and innovative solution.

We take a lot of pride in both the work we do and how we do it. We love trying new approaches, challenging the norm and we’ll never stop striving to be at our technical best. It comes naturally to both our team and the community we work within to help each other’s growth, share and elevate ideas, and meaningfully collaborate as much as possible. Our people are more than the sum of their parts!

That’s why you’ll get an unusual amount of autonomy — you’re here because you’re brilliant, so we trust you to do your role in a way that works for you. Our high-trust culture is one of the things that makes us so successful, so you do you and we’ll be over here, listening and providing support where needed.
We have two core beliefs here:
1) The very best ideas are born from a community that is collaborative, high-trust and diverse. Creating a development-led culture is key to us so we do everything we can to cultivate knowledge sharing and personal growth within our team. That means your questions never go unanswered, and there will always be someone on hand to work through a problem.

2) People are at their best when they have what they need and we’re committed to providing the best possible working environment. Vegan snacks? Slippers for the office? Want to work from another country to spend more time with your family? We got you!

Inclusion is one of our core values. We don’t discriminate by race, religion, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We are not offering UK visa sponsorship at this time and hence unfortunately require of our candidates that they have the right to work in the UK without visa sponsorship.",4.8,"Formidable

We have recently completed our Series A funding with a US based investor (Canvas Ventures) and are building out the team for the next stage of the business.

146,Software engineer,London,Backend Engineer,-1,"At Monzo we’re aiming to build the best current account in the world. We are always keen to hear from capable, creative engineers who want to help us accomplish that goal

Our backend engineers have a variety of different backgrounds

We have several non-graduates; only some of us studied Computer Science; one of the team has a degree in Marketing; some of us have worked in huge companies; some have only ever worked in startups; others are former consultants. As long as you enjoy learning new things, we’d love to talk to you. We do not ask for formal qualifications or degree requirements for any of our engineering roles.

We are actively creating an equitable environment for all of our engineers to thrive

Diversity and inclusion are a priority for us and we are making sure we have lots of support for all of our people to grow at Monzo. We provide a sponsorship framework in Engineering for women and people of colour; all of our leaders are trained on privilege awareness and we are creating partnerships with organisations dedicated to supporting underrepresented groups. You can read more in our 2020 Diversity and Inclusion report.

We encourage an open and transparent working environment

You can get involved in any aspect of the business you are interested in and, following Stripe’s example, all emails in the company are visible in an email archive. We contribute to open source software as much as possible. Our blog is a good place to learn even more about what we do!

Monzo works in project-based sprints in small, interdisciplinary teams

We have around 150 engineers out of roughly 1,400 people in total - and we have big ambitions. There are many interesting challenges ahead, and we're happy for people to move between teams or to specialise, whatever you prefer. As an engineer here you'd be able to work directly with anyone across the company, and we run regular knowledge-sharing sessions so you’ll learn heaps about everything from how banks work to effective communication.

At Monzo you will get to work with a lot of exciting new technology.

We rely heavily on the following tools and technologies:
Go to write our application code (there’s an excellent interactive Go tutorial here)
Cassandra for most persistent data storage
Kafka for our asynchronous message queue
Envoy Proxy for RPC
Kubernetes and Docker to schedule and run our services (Oliver, our VP Architecture, gave a great talk at KubeCon on how we use these technologies)
AWS for most of our infrastructure
React for internal web dashboards
We also have two physical datacenter sites with actual cables to connect to various third parties
Our product squads are truly cross-functional.

This role is all about collaborating across disciplines to test hypotheses and make a difference to customers. As a product backend engineer you’ll work in a squad alongside product managers, marketers, user researchers, designers, mobile engineers, web engineers, data analysts, business analysts, writers and more!

Together you’ll build and support a particular part of Monzo. Our product squads belong to one of four collectives (a word we use to describe self-governing business units of ~100 people). They are: Growth & Core, Borrowing, Operations and Money. They’re all looking for additional Backend Engineers right now.

The Growth & Core collective helps people to discover Monzo and make the most of it.

Growth & Core is a collective focused on different aspects of our mission to ‘make money work for everyone’ and it has four squads. They make users effortlessly financially savvy with features like Budgeting, Pots and the Salary Sorter. Many of the customer problems they solve are revenue opportunities, too – like Monzo Plus, Business Banking, and the Savings marketplace. Last year they also launched our Open Banking APIs, shipped a simpler and more future-proof navigation structure, and enabled Monzo customers to get their salary paid a day early for free!

The Borrowing collective makes borrowing money simple, fair and transparent.

We’re really proud that this fair approach to lending helps people to get what they want from life on their own terms. Squads in Borrowing have already shipped and scaled overdrafts to hundreds of thousands of Monzo customers. They’ve made it easy to take out a loan without the unfair fees or confusing pricing that you find elsewhere. They work on everything from the way borrowing works in the app, right down to how they move and account for money that our customers borrow. One of the most interesting problems they face is deciding how much to lend and to whom. The team believes that they can make access to credit fairer and more transparent.

The Operations collective is responsible for our incredible customer support.

The Operations collective looks after one of the most interesting problem spaces at Monzo: as we grow, we want to ensure that we’re using technology as effectively as possible whilst still maintaining customer service so good that you want to tell your friends. Our engineers within this area of the business help us to explore these challenges. Central to it all is Monzo Chat – a completely bespoke bit of software we’ve built from the ground up to manage chats in our app - but we’re also doing work with machine learning, and looking at how technology can more broadly support our wonderful support team (we call them COps) in other aspects.
The Money collective helps Monzo move fast and in control with our money

We are the bank within the bank and are responsible for the core infrastructure and banking services you associate with Monzo. We are the Guardians of the Monzo Ledger and own everything related to our distinctive Hot Coral cards.

Engineering squads within the Money collective carry out a variety of payments and finance related work, we built our very own Mastercard processor from scratch and recently we successfully replaced a third-party Faster Payments Gateway with our own internal Gateway to reduce outages we can't control. On top of this we've been ensuring our payment schemes are compliant with key regulatory requirements such as Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), 3D Secure V2 (3DSV2), making sure that our core infrastructure and services will scale to support our ambitious growth plans and that we always know where our money is and can report accurately and reliably on it.

The financial crime at Monzo team focuses on making sure our services are a hostile environment for criminals ⛔

We tackle all financial crime together as one team, this includes money laundering, fraud, sanctions breaches, terrorist financing, bribery and corruption and tax evasion. Engineers get to work on core services that are consumed by many different products which means we have a really broad perspective. We've had some major successes in combating financial crime, most famously The Ticketmaster Breach where we spotted large-scale fraudulent activity due to a Ticketmaster data breach before Ticketmaster or other banks did.

The TechOps team
The TechOps team are challenging the traditional IT model by building a brand new people platform to automate all aspects of a Monzo staff member’s time here. We’re building an industry leading people platform to support our staff in a delightful way and to accommodate rapid growth across multiple countries. This approach will allow us to empower our staff by providing smart, efficient and powerful tools instead of relying on traditional IT systems and a horde of IT staff.

You should apply if


Our open roles are for mid-level to senior Backend Engineers at present.
you have strong experience working on the backend of a technology product
you think you’d enjoy the kind of work we’re doing
you want to be involved in building a product that you (and the people you know) use every day
you have a product mindset: you care about customer outcomes and you want to make data-informed decisions
you’re comfortable working in a team that deals with ambiguity
you’re interested in distributed systems and writing resilient software
you have some experience with strongly-typed languages (Go, Java, C, Scala etc.).
Logistics


Salary is around £69,000 - £116,000 plus stock options and other benefits.

We can help you relocate to London & we can sponsor visas.

This role can be based in our London office, but we're open to distributed working (as long as you can spend around 20% of your time in London).

We have payroll set up in four countries: the UK, Ireland, France, and Spain. Right now, we can only hire people who work from those countries and we’ll keep this updated with new ones as we expand and are able to hire from more places

We're usually always hiring for Backend Engineers, so there's no closing date for this job.

We offer flexible working hours and trust you to work enough hours to do your job well, at times that suit you and your team.

Diversity and inclusion is a priority for us – if we want to solve problems for people around the world, our team has to represent our customers. So we need to attract the best talent and create an environment that supports and includes them. You can read more about diversity and inclusion on our blog.

If you prefer to work part-time, we'll make this happen whenever we can - whether this is to help you meet other commitments or strike a great work-life balance.

Our interview process is normally a phone interview, a coding task and call to discuss it, and 2-3 hours of onsite interviews that can be conducted via hangouts as well. We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions. We might design a system together on a whiteboard, the same way we often work together, but we won’t make you write code on one.

Equal Opportunity Statement

At Monzo, embracing diversity in all of its forms and fostering an inclusive environment for all people to do the best work of their lives with us. This is integral to our mission of making money work for everyone.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer, you'll contribute high-quality code to Palantir Gotham or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed to the most important institutions in the public and private sector. You'll build features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world.

Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers. Each team focuses on a specific aspect of a product: for example, you might be part of a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage movement among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product.

Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution, and shipping. As a Software Engineer, you'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them. We think the best way to understand what our users need is to meet them, so occasionally, you'll tour the assembly line at an auto manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and their pain points.

It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!",4.2,"Cisco Systems

Streetbees has a very strong engineering team and platform, combining the best in machine learning, data management pipelines, web platforms and mobile apps. We work with Python for our data science and machine learning, Ruby and Elixir with ReactJS for our web apps and APIs and middleware, and Swift and Kotlin (our Android codebase is 100% Kotlin). Everything is entirely hosted in AWS, all repos in Github, everything containerised.
An opportunity exists for a Python Software Engineer to join our team, particularly those who have enthusiasm to work at the intersection of scalable distributed web platforms with data engineering and machine learning technologies. This is the core of Streetbees technology activities as a leading ‘applied AI’ company - it is one of the most exciting frontiers of modern technology, where new types of software are emerging, and new capabilities that were simply not possible a few years ago are now being created. We are looking for enthusiast to contribute to building something truly great in this space.
The Python Software Engineer will have strong technical and software engineering knowledge relative to their years of experience, so that they are able to make a major contribution to creating production-quality AI solutions.

This is a fully hands on position. Any experience with machine learning engineering using Tensorflow, Keras and PyTorch would be a large advantage, but is not required if someone has strong Python software engineering knowledge in another of the common Python use cases (e.g. web development and data engineering). This is not a role for a pure data engineer or data scientist though, it is a software engineering role and would particularly suit engineers who have significant experience outside of machine learning and a self-motivated interest in developing expertise in machine learning engineering, as a means to produce the new generations of software capability now possible by combining machine learning aspects with established engineering approaches.

Role Responsibilities
Hands-on design, development and support of world class production Python solutions, both web application and machine learning. Contribution to standards about production-quality engineering and QA for Python solutions. Active pull request participation, branch management, other code reviews of other Python developers work etc.
Working with our DevOps team for production Machine Learning AI solutions (DevOps for machine learning is a new area for the industry, with little current conventional best practice, Streetbees expertise in ML creates a real opportunity to do leading-edge DevOps work productionising that). Working with the other engineers to define how Python software engineering should be done
Development and support of data engineering platform, Python web applications and APIs, and machine learning platforms, all on AWS including using specialist ML accelerators
Being an active part of the group of engineers reviewing and making key tech design decisions, and coordinating work and operations
Keeping up to date with the latest evolutions in Python software engineering best practice and technologies
Requirements
Excellent Python knowledge and skills relative to level of experience, including both Python language technicalities, and the technical underpinnings of the Python platform, in particular including maintainability, performance and reliability
Years of commercial experience building and supporting large scale web, app and API platforms with Python relative to experience
Experienced with the AWS application suite (bonus points if you have experience with DevOps technologies around it such as Docker, Kubernetes and Terraform)
Experienced with relational, but also NOSQL, databases (bonus points for Postgres specifically). The more knowledge of data processing, vectorisation and machine learning frameworks the better.
Experience with requirements specification, Python testing tools, with software design patterns, with Agile development processes

About Cuvva

We’re making insurance radically better. How? By building insurance that’s fair and flexible.

Insurance is completely broken. It’s outdated, complicated, rigid – and we get it, insurance (as you know it) doesn’t sound very exciting. But we’re doing things differently. Using pretty cool technology, we’re making insurance way more fit for the 21st century, building products that actually solve problems.

We were the first company in the UK to sell hourly car insurance via an app. And we’re also the only insurance provider that provides in-app customer support with an average one minute response time. We’ve sold over 2 million policies and supported over 300,000 customers. We’re a strong, talented team of 100+ and growing.

Why work for Cuvva?

We don’t cut corners. We strive to do the right thing, even when that makes life more difficult for us.
We’ve nurtured an awesome team culture. We always speak up when we have an idea - but also know when to let go and get behind something else.
And we’re comfortable giving and receiving honest feedback, and trying new ways of doing things.

We’re building a diverse team from different backgrounds, outlooks and experiences. Everyone is given a fair chance of getting a role at Cuvva. Even if you secretly don’t love insurance, trust us, you’ll love what we’re building.
About the role
We're looking for a software engineer who has held senior positions in engineering teams within high-growth, high-scale startups, who will operate with a high level of autonomy, ensuring impeccable reliability and availability. You care deeply about building rock-solid infrastructure for the long term, with a track record of delivering solutions which support your team and your product.
You will develop Cuvva's core platform, abstracting the key processes required to sell insurance, delivering solutions that allow the team to develop strong and stable products, without having to spend time ensuring they get the basics right.
Aside from developing core platform services, we expect you will also become heavily involved with ops and security activities, contributing towards the maintenance of our servers, AWS account, etc.
""Core platform""

When we refer to the ""core platform"", we mean the services which underpin the processes of all insurance activities on our system.
For example, we expect one of these to be the ""policy service"", which might be responsible for ensuring compliant issuance of policies, coordinating mid-term adjustments, preventing overlapping policies (double insurance), etc.

Other services could include user authentication, risk & pricing calculation, handling the process of modifying user data in-line with any mid-term adjustment requirements.
All services we consider to be part of the core platform will have strict requirements around stability, data integrity and transactional safety. All functionality must fail safely and explicitly, for example using 2-phase commit processes or other similar techniques. This will also require a reasonable level of testing to validate this safety.

The perfect addition to our team will have:
a fiercely independent and self-driven approach
5+ years' commercial experience working on back-end systems at high-scale startups
at least a year of commercial experience working with Go
strong knowledge of security practices, ideally with a slightly grey-hat background
a working knowledge of the entire web stack - from how DNS lookups are transmitted, to how browsers prioritize CSS rules
awareness of compliance and financial regulation

We are a small team so it is important that the successful candidate is not only technically highly competent, but also a great cultural fit!

Compensation
As well as a competitive salary (£75-90k, dependent on experience) and equity based remuneration, benefits of working at Cuvva include:
Professional development budget
Brand new MacBook
Health and wellbeing budget
Enhanced parental leave
Workplace pension scheme
33 days of holiday a year (including public holidays )
Mates rates on your insurance
Work-from-home Wednesdays (Currently Work-from-home everyday!)
Referral bonus when you bring your friends to join the Cuvva team
Office library full of great books
Fresh fruit and breakfast club every day
Season ticket loans
Cycle to work scheme
A day off to volunteer
One-to-one sessions with our Sanctus coach, giving you a safe space to talk about your mental health
Coffee machine in the office
Fully stocked beer and soft drink fridge - we do team drinks every Thursday
Regular team lunches
Monthly team outings (so far we’ve done things like karaoke, go-karting, bowling and comedy nights
About Cuvva
A new kind of insurance
We started with a problem: nobody was offering short-term car insurance by the hour.
But we soon realised insurance isn't just lacking. It's completely broken. It's built on layers of middlemen and outdated systems. So Cuvva turned from a simple idea into a full-blown mission: to offer insurance the way it should be.

We think insurance should be fast, flexible and clear. So we've cut out the middlemen, ditched the jargon and put our heart and soul into customer support.",4.3,"Cuvva

Zopa’s mission is to create a richer life for everyone by making money fair and simple. We do this by building great financial products, like our award-winning personal loans and our hugely popular investment products. We’ve also just launched a new Credit Card and Savings accounts. These products are underpinned by a business model which means that we win when the customer wins – unlike many other financial products which rely on customers making mistakes or being misinformed to make money.

Building a new Credit Card platform for the modern age. We’ve just launched a new credit card product built on our own tech. You could take part in scaling it to more customers, solve some difficult performance problems when authorising transactions, or work on exciting new features.
New micro-services: re-writing specific parts of our previous infrastructure into the new micro-services communicating through Kafka.
Building Open Banking products from scratch. This ranges from verifying the income and identity of a customer in a few seconds over assessing credit risk in a new and fairer way to providing savings and lending insights to customers in our app. This is a nascent technology where you have the freedom to create products from scratch, use cutting edge technology and shake up an old industry.
Personal Finance Management feature or system. This might be a new way of verifying income, a budgeting service, or a new API to drive insights for customers. Whatever it is, you will be heavily involved from understanding the space and opportunity all the way to developing the release-ready code and seeing it through to launch and maintenance.
Building a new Credit Card billing and statement generation engine, a card specific origination pipeline or integrating with third party processing and fraud prevention partners to enable a card that can work seamlessly and securely. Whatever it is, you will be heavily involved from understanding the space and opportunity all the way to developing the release-ready code and seeing it through to launch and maintenance.
Pioneering a digital, customer-centric car finance solution, to disrupt a broken and unfair market where paper contracts and scanners are still the norm. Responsibilities range from building out a highly automated quotation and reservation pipeline, to developing new microservices to support a greenfield, end-to-end dealer product.
Building our own internal services to coordinate how our consumer products (like loans or savings accounts) can manage sending and receiving money. It covers a range of payment channels – Faster Payments, Direct Debits, debit cards to name a few. This comes with plenty of technical challenges to make sure our services are easy to use, flexible enough to work for any product, but allow for operational scale: growth in volumes, growth in the range of products, employing a distributed architecture, and increasing the variety of payment channels with which we want to integrate.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, all of us here at Zopa are currently working remotely.
Moving beyond this and assuming Covid-19 is no longer a threat, this position will be remote-first with the option to work from our office in London Bridge a few days a week.

We’re empowering people to FeelGood about their money.
We’ve been on this journey since 2004, when we built the first ever peer-to-peer lending company to give people access to simpler, better-value loans and investments. When it comes to money, we think everyone deserves a fair deal, so since we launched, we’ve helped hundreds of thousands of customers to take the stress out of money by building our business on honesty, transparency and trust.
Our journey’s always evolving, and we’ve just launched a bank. But a different type of bank – one that empowers its customers to take control of their finances and FeelGood about their money.
If you embrace being challenged beyond the norm, aren’t afraid to think differently and are motivated by working somewhere you can really make an impact, you’ll love life here at Zopa.

Job Title: Senior Software Engineer
Salary: Competitive
Location: London Bridge
Advert Start Date: Tuesday 6th October 2020
Closing Date: Tuesday 3rd November 2020

The Challenge:
Zopa’s mission is to create a richer life for everyone by making money fair and simple. We do this by building great financial products, like our award-winning personal loans and our hugely popular investment products. We’ve also just launched a new Credit Card and Savings accounts. These products are underpinned by a business model which means that we win when the customer wins – unlike many other financial products which rely on customers making mistakes or being misinformed to make money.
In 2020 we launched Zopa Bank with cutting edge technologies and are looking for talented mid and senior level Java Software Engineers to work on bringing our products to more and more customers.
The Role:
You will be working in a small, agile and adaptable cross-functional team and utilising Kafka and Kafka Streams to build a resilient, scalable backbone that powers the growth of the company. You can expect to interact with stakeholders and key business users daily. We are big believers in a lean philosophy and flexibility in implementation, while aiming to achieve stack consistency and alignment across the board. All of our JVM infrastructure is deployed with Docker/Kubernetes as often as we need to via CI (Jenkins) and a completely automated test suite.
Here is some of the Tech Stack you will be working with: Java, Kafka, Kotlin , React, React-Native, Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, RabbitMQ, AWS Aurora Postgres, Babel just to name a few.
About you:
You love shipping great products, not just writing superb code.
You are a fast learner and enjoy getting stuck into difficult problems
As an engineer, you’re interested in the problem, not just the requirements.
You feel comfortable in a fast-moving environment and are ambitious about the speed and quality of your code. We ship our code multiple times a week with the impact measured in the result for the customer, not lines of code.
An advocate of test driven development or, even better, behaviour-driven development. A strong commitment to quality is essential.
You've worked on large scale distributed software systems that have proven scalability and complex topologies.
Enjoy talking to key stakeholders and understand and show passion for the business objectives of the company.
You are comfortable with a fair bit of uncertainty, fast change, and love solving hard problems collaboratively.
You are a team player who thrives working in an honest and friendly working atmosphere. We have a flat hierarchy and give you the opportunity to make a real impact.
Experience with Kafka and/or a streams-based platform (Samza, Storm) is a plus!
Here are some of the Projects you could expect to be working on:
Building a new Credit Card platform for the modern age. We’ve just launched a new credit card product built on our own tech. You could take part in scaling it to more customers, solve some difficult performance problems when authorising transactions, or work on exciting new features.
New micro-services: re-writing specific parts of our previous infrastructure into the new micro-services communicating through Kafka.
Building Open Banking products from scratch. This ranges from verifying the income and identity of a customer in a few seconds over assessing credit risk in a new and fairer way to providing savings and lending insights to customers in our app. This is a nascent technology where you have the freedom to create products from scratch, use cutting edge technology and shake up an old industry.
Personal Finance Management feature or system. This might be a new way of verifying income, a budgeting service, or a new API to drive insights for customers. Whatever it is, you will be heavily involved from understanding the space and opportunity all the way to developing the release-ready code and seeing it through to launch and maintenance.
Building a new Credit Card billing and statement generation engine, a card specific origination pipeline or integrating with third party processing and fraud prevention partners to enable a card that can work seamlessly and securely. Whatever it is, you will be heavily involved from understanding the space and opportunity all the way to developing the release-ready code and seeing it through to launch and maintenance.
Pioneering a digital, customer-centric car finance solution, to disrupt a broken and unfair market where paper contracts and scanners are still the norm. Responsibilities range from building out a highly automated quotation and reservation pipeline, to developing new microservices to support a greenfield, end-to-end dealer product.
Building our own internal services to coordinate how our consumer products (like loans or savings accounts) can manage sending and receiving money. It covers a range of payment channels – Faster Payments, Direct Debits, debit cards to name a few. This comes with plenty of technical challenges to make sure our services are easy to use, flexible enough to work for any product, but allow for operational scale: growth in volumes, growth in the range of products, employing a distributed architecture, and increasing the variety of payment channels with which we want to integrate.

Role Title: Software Engineer
Job Location: London
[INTRO]
Punk Money is a hugely disruptive Fin-Tech start-up that is developing a completely new type of financial platform with a community at its core.
We're looking for a Software Engineer to join our growing team in London, someone who can implement quickly, solve problems and iterate. You’ll be joining an established team with professional careers from advertising and banking giants, as well as two of Europe’s largest Fintechs.
We’re decentralising money away from the banks and putting it back in peoples hands. We’re empowering our people to invest in each other and save together, easing cash flow and providing high return investments to our users.
It's Money for the People, by the People.

[ABOUT THE ROLE]
A primary engineering role for us, the focus will be on frontend web development with some database integration (full stack). We are a customer-facing fintech, with the associated security needs and our products will operate within those constraints.
We have been operating a lean development approach, building MVPs where appropriate, we now need to develop some existing products to production standard, and implement the next ones.
This is a unique opportunity to join the early stages of a fast growing and disruptive business. We’re flexible on the package: we would like to bring the right person into the founding team with commensurate equity, or we can explore a project-based structure.
You are a crucial part of the development process, and will typically work closely with a product owner (and perhaps a product designer) to deliver your product. Working at Punk Money isn’t about being a cog in a machine, we’re looking for people with ideas and inspiration to share.
[ABOUT YOU]
Here’s some features to illustrate what we think we need - show us what you’ve built, make it clear what you can bring
Created and owned various customer-facing development projects, with examples to excite us
Have experience developing in a modern front-end framework
Familiar with database integration and efficient use, can design and implement simple schemas
A considered developer, conscious of the whole product and end customer experience
Able to develop independently, creating code that is maintainable by others in the team
A design-conscious approach, and enthusiasm, is a plus - UX is important for us
Translate technical concepts for, and communicate with, the wider team
[ABOUT THE TEAM]
You’ll be joining a highly motivated founding team with the branding, ideas, business plan and products already in production. We are currently raising Seed capital to finalise production and launch the product. The existing team are marketing and product experts who’ve already had excellent feedback and already have significant traction with their current product.
[OUR VALUES]
From the first hire to the last, from the most junior to the most senior it is important that everyone shares our core values:
Make it Happen: Punk’s always been a DIY culture and we’re all about getting things done. We’re after people who share this ethos, who roll up their sleeves and get stuck in and make amazing things happen.
Be a Champion, not a Challenger: We’re a champion of the people. We stand for the little guy, the overlooked, the ripped-off and abused. We’re here to make a difference to people's lives, not to challenge other companies.
Be Excellent to Each Other: This is us to the core. It means, do what's right for all parties involved, even if it’s hard to achieve.
Stand for Something: We’re the rebels with a cause. We’ve been ripped off by banks long enough. Now is the time to fight back, to unite, to create new services which are fairer, cheaper and easier to use.
Community First: This is at the heart of everything we do. We unite people and solve their problems as a collective allowing them to better understand their finances and get out of debt and invest their savings in other members so that everyone prospers.
If you think this sounds like your kind of place to work then we’d love to hear from you

Now the Improbable Defence division, building on the backbone of SpatialOS, has combined world class scientific modelling, market leading AI, mission specific user interfaces and a uniquely flexible and secure deployment model to create a powerful simulation platform tailored to the needs of the military.

Our mission? To enable the most realistic and effective military simulations ever experienced, making defence users more effective on operations and decreasing the cost of military preparedness.


Your Mission
...is to build scientific models that support our entire product offering and facilitate next generation decision support. We are a friendly, relaxed & inclusive team with an ambition to take agent-based modelling to the next level. Unlike many teams, we are a mix of applied scientists and software engineers working very collaboratively both internally and with our Defence customers.

We build software models of social systems as goal-oriented actors operating on imperfect information, “digitally twin” physical environments and infrastructure, and obsess with modularity to recast complex systems as combinations of simpler systems. Our applied scientists seek to balance cutting-edge research with pragmatism and creativity when designing new models. We touch on a range of interesting topics such as probabilistic programming and reinforcement learning to name just two.
Your Impact
You will work broadly; conceptualising a system and writing a design document, building software to convert that into a prototype model (we are language agnostic, and usually work in Python and C++) and you will help educate others on your approach.
Your role will combine literature reviews, conceptual modelling & software engineering to create scientifically defensible models that underpin our product offering
Building software pipelines to extract and integrate data from various sources, making it available to simulation engines and user interfaces.
You will be building socio-technical models of real-world phenomena that allow our customers to better understand how individuals interact with physical, political, information and other systems.
Your work will help military tacticians understand situations and plan more effectively, ultimately helping add to the stability and security of the world.
Current or recent UK security vetting clearance (SC) is advantageous but not mandatory.
If you identify with the following, we'd love to chat:
You are an experienced software engineer with fluency in at least one relevant OO or functional programming language and the openness to learn and adapt to a variety of languages. We currently use Python and C++ a lot as well as many of the related tools and libraries.
You support and have a clear appreciation of the modern software engineering workflow & delivery mechanisms.
You are enthusiastic about continuously improving and rapidly developing new competencies.
You are able to effectively communicate with clients in person, in writing and with visualisation.
You have an interest in machine learning engineering (e.g. agent-based modelling, discrete-event simulation, system dynamics, bayesian networks, probabilistic programming, machine learning).

While we think the above experience could be important, we’re keen to hear from people that believe they have valuable experience to bring to the role.

Please note due to the nature of this role you will be expected to meet requirements associated with obtaining UK security vetting clearance.

Equal Opportunity

Nuke is in search of a C++ Software Engineer specialising in Build and Test Infrastructure for the Nuke team. This role will focus - not exclusively - on providing tools and support for our Nuke feature teams, by working directly on refining our cross-platform CMake/Conan build infrastructure, our Python test infrastructure, and by helping to mentor the rest of the team in these areas.

The ideal candidate is the sort of developer that knew their team could make much better use of their tools, and rolled up their sleeves to push through major build system improvements to the benefit of everyone. You probably care about compiler features and you can often spot a problematic build flag a mile off. You care that an incremental build is as fast as possible to improve C++ iteration times. You understand and care about how libraries, symbols and linkage can affect correctness, build times and symbol clashes, and you appreciate that each OS is different and may need to be handled accordingly.

This is a unique opportunity to play a key role in the team that develops the industry-leading compositing package for the VFX industry. You’ll bring your existing skills, and also learn new ones, as we continuously strive for improvement in software development and deployment.

The Responsibilities
Work as part of the Nuke team to improve, maintain, develop, document and implement automated build, release, and test pipelines. Your aim would be to empower the various Nuke sub-teams to make their own minor tweaks and fixes so they can function without your help, while you focus on bigger improvements
Improve Nuke's Conan & CMake-based build system, and review changes to the build system from your colleagues to ensure it continues improving
Improve test harness framework code, including static analysis functionality, Python frameworks used by QA engineers and white-box test code used by software engineers
With respect to the above items, you will collaborate with Foundry's cross-product Platform Team to help them improve things Foundry-wide
Play an active part in aiding troubleshooting of the pipeline, collating and prioritising feedback to input back into the roadmap for both your work and that of the Platform Team
Optimise Nuke’s use of our internal build/test farm throughout the lifecycle, with a view to deploying some of this infrastructure into the cloud in the future.
Help to create and manage branches for feature development and releases, taking into account available CI resources.
Troubleshoot and fix problems in the C++ application code arising from code integrations.
As with all Software Engineer roles at Foundry, you will help to ensure the quality, scalability, and extensibility of the code that we’re writing - starting with your own but extending to code reviews and design of others as well.
Requirements
3 - 5 years C++ application development
Significant experience of build and release engineering.
Strong experience with build management and continuous integration tools like Jenkins, Bamboo, TeamCity, or Travis. Experience with Jenkins and Groovy scripting would be strongly preferred.
Proficiency with a scripting language such as Python
Experience of Version Control Systems (e.g. Perforce, Git)
Experience with cross-platform development (OSX, Linux, Windows) beneficial
Experience of the virtualisation platforms (e.g. vSphere) and containerisation beneficial

Our goal is to redefine primary care and the technology that supports it. We want to become a mission-critical tool for 100,000+ health and care professionals, to help them improve the health and wellbeing of 10m+ people, by 2025.
We’re backed by PUBLIC, a pioneer in the GovTech space, running an accelerator program in 4 countries, convening an annual summit, and writing cutting-edge research. Led by ex-deputy head of the No.10 policy unit, Daniel Korski, and venture investor, Alexander de Carvalho, PUBLIC’s team has operational experience in government, startups, technology, and finance.

Back-end development fundamentals (any modern high-level language, with a preference for functional)
Knowledge sharing ability (mentoring, talks, etc)
Automated testing at various levels (unit, functional, integration etc.)
Navigating legacy systems
Cloud-based systems (serverless / container-based)
Working to be compliant in a regulated environment (e.g. health, finance)

Culture
We’re not just engineering systems, we’re engineering a company. Preserving our culture is the most important thing to us as we scale. It’s the way we come together to find the best solutions, and how we hold ourselves accountable to achieving our vision: delivering success for our customers and meaningful experiences for our people.

Do Something Big: The future promises a lot—the Internet of Everything, smart connected cities, transparent markets, virtual medicine—but these advances require more than what's possible with conventional solutions. We’ve developed a new way to build distributed systems. For over a decade, we’ve used it to build complex trading systems for the world’s largest financial institutions, and now we’re starting to solve real-time problems across every industry.

Blaze Your Own Trail: We’re at an exciting stage—small but growing fast. There are unprecedented opportunities to learn and lead right away. Whatever your goals, from heads-down development to collaborating with customers, from executing and streamlining our business to leading teams, from innovating new products to opening up new industries, or a bit of “all of the above"", we’ll work together to get you there. There is no one path. You’ll have the freedom to follow your interests as they evolve.

Solve Hard Problems: The engineering we do is complex—thousands of globally distributed components, vast amounts of fast-moving shared data, continuous real-time analysis and execution, always-on mission-critical performance. It ordinarily takes years to solve these problems (think aerospace or flight control) but that’s not an option for us. Our fintech executes hundreds of billions of dollars in trades each day, so there’s huge value in launching ideas fast. We invent smarter designs and smarter ways to develop and test, so we can innovate in quick cycles without compromising the exacting requirements inherent to the systems we build.

Be Greater Together: We tackle problems no one could solve alone, so we’re here to learn from each other. Each insight is a springboard for the next. We encourage disagreement to achieve a greater outcome. But solving hard problems is only part of the equation—we hire people who inspire us and enjoy working together. The result is a team that truly “clicks”.

Do the Right Thing: Building a healthy, lasting company starts from the inside out. Our progressive policies and practices foster transparency, integrity, openness, and forward thinking. We are deeply committed to building a company that empowers people, enables them to thrive throughout their careers, and do big things here.

You will ideally know AWS as well as you know your best friend, although it’s great if you’re good friends with other cloud services, too.
You will have diligently practiced your engineering craft, mastering your skills in techniques such as TDD, refactoring, clean code and pair programming.
You will have implemented CI pipelines and automation, championed the quality and deployment benefits of both to others.
The product(s) you’ve built will have delighted users (perhaps millions of them!) while being stable, performant, observable and supportable.

Why Zoopla…

We are spiritually agile, not religiously agile.
We strongly believe in the value of good design. We believe it is a primary differentiator in an increasingly crowded marketplace.
We believe in the value of data. We run a team that is data informed. We think being data-driven is soulless and dangerous. Clean, confident, clear data combined with the insights of the team is what drives our decisions.
We want to build small, collaborative, cross-functional teams that push each other to create elegant, simple solutions to difficult customer problems.

About Cuvva

We’re making insurance radically better. How? By building insurance that’s fair and flexible.

Insurance is completely broken. It’s outdated, complicated, rigid – and we get it, insurance (as you know it) doesn’t sound very exciting. But we’re doing things differently. Using pretty cool technology, we’re making insurance way more fit for the 21st century, building products that actually solve problems.

We were the first company in the UK to sell hourly car insurance via an app. And we’re also the only insurance provider that provides in-app customer support with an average one minute response time. We’ve sold over 2 million policies and supported over 300,000 customers. We’re a strong, talented team of 100+ and growing.

Why work for Cuvva?

We don’t cut corners. We strive to do the right thing, even when that makes life more difficult for us.
We’ve nurtured an awesome team culture. We always speak up when we have an idea - but also know when to let go and get behind something else.
And we’re comfortable giving and receiving honest feedback, and trying new ways of doing things.

We’re building a diverse team from different backgrounds, outlooks and experiences. Everyone is given a fair chance of getting a role at Cuvva. Even if you secretly don’t love insurance, trust us, you’ll love what we’re building.
About the role
We're looking for a software engineer who has held senior positions in engineering teams within high-growth, high-scale startups, who will operate with a high level of autonomy, ensuring impeccable reliability and availability. You care deeply about building rock-solid infrastructure for the long term, with a track record of delivering solutions which support your team and your product.
You will develop Cuvva's core platform, abstracting the key processes required to sell insurance, delivering solutions that allow the team to develop strong and stable products, without having to spend time ensuring they get the basics right.
Aside from developing core platform services, we expect you will also become heavily involved with ops and security activities, contributing towards the maintenance of our servers, AWS account, etc.
""Core platform""

When we refer to the ""core platform"", we mean the services which underpin the processes of all insurance activities on our system.
For example, we expect one of these to be the ""policy service"", which might be responsible for ensuring compliant issuance of policies, coordinating mid-term adjustments, preventing overlapping policies (double insurance), etc.

Other services could include user authentication, risk & pricing calculation, handling the process of modifying user data in-line with any mid-term adjustment requirements.
All services we consider to be part of the core platform will have strict requirements around stability, data integrity and transactional safety. All functionality must fail safely and explicitly, for example using 2-phase commit processes or other similar techniques. This will also require a reasonable level of testing to validate this safety.

The perfect addition to our team will have:
a fiercely independent and self-driven approach
5+ years' commercial experience working on back-end systems at high-scale startups
at least a year of commercial experience working with Go
strong knowledge of security practices, ideally with a slightly grey-hat background
a working knowledge of the entire web stack - from how DNS lookups are transmitted, to how browsers prioritize CSS rules
awareness of compliance and financial regulation

We are a small team so it is important that the successful candidate is not only technically highly competent, but also a great cultural fit!

Compensation
As well as a competitive salary (£75-90k, dependent on experience) and equity based remuneration, benefits of working at Cuvva include:
Professional development budget
Brand new MacBook
Health and wellbeing budget
Enhanced parental leave
Workplace pension scheme
33 days of holiday a year (including public holidays )
Mates rates on your insurance
Work-from-home Wednesdays (Currently Work-from-home everyday!)
Referral bonus when you bring your friends to join the Cuvva team
Office library full of great books
Fresh fruit and breakfast club every day
Season ticket loans
Cycle to work scheme
A day off to volunteer
One-to-one sessions with our Sanctus coach, giving you a safe space to talk about your mental health
Coffee machine in the office
Fully stocked beer and soft drink fridge - we do team drinks every Thursday
Regular team lunches
Monthly team outings (so far we’ve done things like karaoke, go-karting, bowling and comedy nights
About Cuvva
A new kind of insurance
We started with a problem: nobody was offering short-term car insurance by the hour.
But we soon realised insurance isn't just lacking. It's completely broken. It's built on layers of middlemen and outdated systems. So Cuvva turned from a simple idea into a full-blown mission: to offer insurance the way it should be.

We think insurance should be fast, flexible and clear. So we've cut out the middlemen, ditched the jargon and put our heart and soul into customer support.",4.3,"Cuvva
