Do you want to “hack the gibson?” Do you enjoy playing a “nice game of chess”? If we said “hack the planet” would you be able to tell us the film? At KPMG we are looking for a Senior Manager who lives and breathes hacking and information security. You will have earned your stripes doing CHECK work in data centres and be ready to, or already skilled in leading teams of talented testers.

• Knowledge of working in secure environments (List X facilities) and accredited labs (ISO17025)
• Research and Development experience
• Threat Intelligence experience
• Standing and positive reputation in the information security community is seen as a plus.
Qualifications and Skills

Qualifications are a good way to demonstrate knowledge but are not the be all and end all, our team is made up of many individuals with diverse backgrounds who all share the “hacker mindset”.
If you have the experience, then we want you to apply. Didn’t do a degree in information security? A-Levels weren’t as good as you hoped. Haven’t attended every SANS course going, we don’t mind!
For this role we only have two formal requirements.
• CREST CCSAS qualification or be working towards CCSAS and ready to sit soon.
• UK Government Security Clearance – the ability to apply for and hold SC is required, DV is advantageous.
