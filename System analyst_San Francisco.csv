Payments are the core of Stripe's business, and the groups and teams within Payments Infrastructure are broadly responsible for processing and moving these funds at a huge scale.

From the outside, a customer's credit card is charged and the merchant receives a payout to their bank account.

We're here to support each other in our curiosity and creativity – which we pursue through thoughtful discussion and knowledge-sharing among a diverse set of peers and colleagues.

We want to work in a company of warm, inclusive people who treat their colleagues exceptionally well. The kind of people who are committed to going out of their way to help other Stripes in the short-term and pushing them to improve over the long-term (by helping them to get better at what they do).

We're a highly cross-functional organization and view that as part of the fun: we design our space to encourage as much collaboration as possible. We have long tables in the kitchen for a reason (to enable everyone to meet new people and learn from them). We also have a culture of transparency that we carry through to email communication, ensuring that Stripes all around the world have the information they need to make good local decisions.

In both our products and our people, we aim to reflect, represent and advocate for all of our users, globally. Our users transcend geography, culture and language; what we share, collectively, is a drive to create a fairer, more economically interconnected world.",4.2,"Stripe

Essai, Inc. is in search of inquisitive, creative, determined candidates who enjoy problem-solving and taking a theoretical concept into real-world applications to fill our *(System Administrator) *position.

Essai, Inc. is a dynamic and innovative high-tech manufacturing company located in *(**Fremont, CA**)*. We are looking for exceptional individuals to join our team, who have high desire and drive to succeed both personally and professionally, in a fast paced and growing company. Located in the heart of Silicon Valley, Essai is a diverse, environmental-friendly company whose commitment to excellence has been recognized by America’s Fastest–Growing Private 5000 Companies.
JOB RESPONSIBILITY*
This is an excellent opportunity for an experienced Microsoft Windows Server systems administrator at our automated manufacturing and assembly plant located in the east side of the Silicon Valley in Fremont, CA. This position will be responsible for the day-to-day technical support, administration, maintenance, and documentation of an existing production network of servers, manufacturing control and engineering workstations, and desktop and laptop PCs, under the supervision of managing IT personnel.

In addition to day-to-day technical support, your primary responsibility will be maintaining the IT infrastructure and supporting environment that keeps our automated manufacturing machines’ spindles spinning. Therefore, this is a 24x7x365 on-call position, which includes monitoring critical system alerts. Occasional early, late, and/or long hours are required.

To be successful, you must be able to work independently, Monday–Friday from 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM, cultivate professional relationships with key stakeholders throughout the facility, and maintain a positive and enthusiastic approach. Importantly, you must stop, listen to and triage internal IT customer’s issues on demand, isolate or escalate their technical problems, and execute appropriate solutions for them.
MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS*
TECHNICAL COMPETENCE: Four years of solid Microsoft Windows Server operating experience in a corporate networked environment that demonstrates a broad skillset. This skillset should include: comprehensive knowledge of Microsoft Active Directory, DNS and DHCP, internal trust relationships, file systems, rights and permissions, access tokens and ACLs, and the Computer Browser Service — the basics of Windows file services.

Strong working knowledge of Windows administrative tools and command-line utilities. Clear understanding of IPv4 addressing, IP subnetting, IP routing, and TCP/IP core protocols and services in addition to DNS and DHCP: including ARP, ICMP, SMTP, RPC, HTTP, SSL and SMB/CIFS — to name a few — along with their associated utilities. The methods and sequence of name resolution for commands and tools that use the WinSock and NetBIOS interfaces.

Familiarity with the physical media and working characteristics of IEEE 802.3 Ethernet specifications, TIA Category 5/5e/6/6A cabling standards, and TIA-568B pinouts; the address space of the private internets as defined in RFCs 1918 and 3927; along with IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi concepts and SNIA standard RAID levels. Exchange Server and VMware administration experience is a plus.

COMMUNICATION SKILLS: To achieve our communications skills requirements you should be formally and rigorously trained and have a Microsoft MCSE certification — or a current Microsoft equivalent — in one of the various Microsoft Windows Server generations starting with Windows 2000 Server or above. Your certification(s) should include passed exams in TCP/IP core protocols and services.

We want you to be able to accurately convey technical concepts in English both to colleagues and, with a suitable adjustment, to non-technical internal IT customers. As an essential adjunct to work experience, education and other achievements, we’ve found that people with formal vendor skills-based training who have diligently put in the effort to pass exams and earn an appropriate vendor certification have developed a naturally accompanying aptitude and vocabulary to communicate these technical concepts and complex ideas quickly, clearly and concisely.

A necessary consequence of supporting our fast-paced production environment with these types of skills is that you must also be able to speak and write in English, easily, fluently, and coherently.

Reciting the NATO phonetic alphabet in under 10 seconds, cold, is a definite plus.

RIGHT ATTITUDE: In addition to technical competence and communication skills, we place a high premium on right attitude. Behavior is important. We are looking for an individual who is willing to be a first point of contact for the IT department in Fremont, who has a track record of offering a customer-oriented mindset, and who has an established history of collaborating with colleagues.

On a day-to-day basis, this requires (a) being present Monday–Friday from 8:00 – 5:00 PM, (b) reaching out to, cultivating, and maintaining excellent, open channels of communication with internal IT customers, and (c) providing quick and positive responses to your teammates in the IT department by being readily forthcoming and fulsome with your technical knowledge, skills, and configurations — passing them on freely, without obligation.

An easy, genuine, gracious willingness to drop what you’re doing and serve other people on demand — both customers and teammates, alike — is an expectation! Likewise, the ability to expand your consciousness beyond yourself in an attempt to see and take into account other people’s viewpoints with a little dry wit, a friendly smile, and a great sense of humor is most welcome!
SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, AND ABILITIES REQUIRED*
A Bachelor of Science degree in science, technology, engineering, or math is certainly preferred, but not required. We will also gladly welcome degrees in music, languages, linguistics, or related disciplines that share the cognitive domains of metrical structure, recursion, and the use of memory. Again, not required, but unquestionably a plus.

On the other hand, as many people have proven, college degrees are not always the be-all/end-all requirement for fruitful economic participation or a great career. However, if for no other reason, the process of attaining any four-year degree demonstrates a worthwhile common denominator: it shows the extent to which we are willing to exert our will power, exercise self-control, set aside other desires, and sustain these disciplines over long durations to achieve something of significance.

Knowing what we want, setting long-term goals, resolving to accomplish them, procuring funding, associating with people who can help us get what we want, reliably fulfilling obligations, planning our work, adhering to a schedule, balancing our lives, devoting our energies efficiently and effectively, working and playing well with others, accepting correction — all while using our volition over four years to responsibly execute a wide variety of difficult tasks, stick with them, and see them all through to completion — a college degree tells an employer quite a lot.

So, if you do not have a four-year college degree but you meet the minimum qualifications, listed above — technical competence, communication skills, and right attitude — and you can truly establish in writing, by outlining a history of previous achievements, your abilities to plan, manage and execute tasks, and see assignments and projects through to completion with little to no supervision, then we’ll happily consider that in lieu of a four-year degree. If this is the case, please be equipped with a list of your lifetime achievements, briefly stated on a single sheet of paper.

You should also be able to sit and work at a computer keyboard with a mouse for extended periods of time; stoop, kneel, bend and reach from the waist on a daily basis; leverage a hand truck, operate and push/pull a pallet jack, and climb a ladder or ride a scissor lift to service enclosure-, rack-, floor-, wall-, or ceiling-mounted equipment. Occasionally, you’ll need to be able to move and lift up to 60 pounds above your waste or 50 pounds overhead — equivalents of a box of 10 reams of paper, 24 and 20 lb., respectively.

Please come prepared with three professional references, listing your supervisors from previous employers that can substantiate your background, including their current contact information.
Please Note: * This position is for our *(**Fremont, CA**)* location. There is no relocation assistance or visa sponsorship offered at this time. Job offers are pending successful completion of a background check, drug screen, and reference check.
Due to the large volume of resumes received, we are unable to acknowledge receipt of all applications. Candidates who meet specific qualifications will be contacted during the course of this search.

This is a full-time, contract to hire position.

Our Values


We believe we can help build a future for everyone.

We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.
Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.
Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

The Opportunity

Our work in education is aimed at ensuring that every student — not just a lucky few — can get an education that's tailored to their individual needs and supports every aspect of their development. We're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy, and advocacy work to help every young person enter adulthood with the skills and abilities they need to reach their full potential — and equip every teacher with the tools and research they need to help students get there.

We know that when students feel supported, cared for, and understood, they thrive. Now more than ever, teachers and students need efficient and supportive tools to ensure education is anchored in relationships and well-being. Along is a new tool designed to achieve exactly that – a free, interactive video journal designed to foster meaningful connections between teachers and students.

Along provides a meaningful space where teachers and students can share one-on-one reflections via recorded video or text conversations and dive into important topics — such as managing stress, staying motivated, and navigating the new challenges these times present. The Along team is looking for a Senior Software Engineer to build scalable and engaging experiences.

Across three core Initiative focus areas of Science, Education and Justice and Opportunity, we're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and movement building, to help build an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.

Our Values


We believe we can help build a future for everyone.
We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.
We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.
Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.
Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

The Opportunity


By pairing engineers with leaders in our education, science, and justice and opportunity teams, we can bring technology to the table in new ways to help drive solutions. We are uniquely positioned to design, build, and scale software systems to help educators, scientists, and policy experts better address the myriad challenges they face.

In our Science Initiative, our mission is to support science and technology that will help make it possible to cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of the century. Interdisciplinary teams of physicians, biologists, computational scientists, and engineers can expand our understanding of the human body and illness — the very science behind medicine. CZI fosters collaboration between scientists and engineers, develops tools and technologies, and builds support for basic scientific research.

Some Science Initiative example projects include:
IDseq - a metagenomics platform that delivers insights in infectious disease
cellxgene - an open source interactive data explorer for single-cell transcriptomics data
Meta - a semantic discovery tool that provides a faster way to understand, organize and explore science through personalized feeds
Starfish - an open source image processing framework, enabling access to multiplex image-based transcriptomics analysis
napari - an open source interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for python
As a Senior Software Engineer on the IDseq team, you will have the opportunity to build out our Infectious Disease Sequencing tool, a collaboration between CZI and Chan Zuckerberg Biohub. The tool, which began as a research project at Dr. Joseph DeRisi's lab at the University of California, San Francisco, works by rapidly combing through terabytes of metagenomic data for pathogens in a given sample — be they bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites. IDseq has demonstrated its ability to detect disease in the field by helping scientists in Bangladesh determine the cause of a meningitis outbreak, by helping researchers in Cambodia confirm the country's first case of COVID-19, and through other pilot projects at global health research sites around the world in partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It has also been used extensively by researchers at Chan Zuckerberg Biohub and other US research institutions, processing more than 40,000 samples and hundreds of terabytes of data.

You will
Drive user impact and delight by working across the web stack, from the data access layer to the presentation layer (SQL, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React), with an emphasis on the frontend
Build and improve rich, interactive, data-intensive visualizations of scientific results, as well as flows for submitting, generating and organizing data
Work with Product Managers, UX Designers, and biological scientists to design, build and support new technical solutions
Be a leader who takes on projects with high scope, assesses trade-offs between building on existing open source tools versus crafting new ones in-house, and promotes engineering excellence around web application development
You have
Strong experience as a full-stack web developer shipping complex products end-to-end with minimal guidance (5+ years)
Strong experience in frontend development (JavaScript, React)
Strong experience in server-side web frameworks
Experience working with relational databases

About Us: At Emendata, we help bridge the gap between data and the real world. We partner with organizations that have a social mission and help them tackle their problems using analytics. Our role in these partnerships goes end to end—we handle everything from wrangling the data to analyzing the problem to turning the results into something actionable. Importantly, we understand that this analytics pipeline does not live in a vacuum. Getting to meaningful numbers requires more than just the right methods; it calls for understanding the people, policies, data, and systems involved. With this approach, our small but fast-growing team is having a big impact, taking on challenges like using analytics to combat fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare.
About the Role: This role leads the way in producing analytics that reflect a deep level of understanding and a high degree of quality. We are looking for you to:
Take analyses from end to end: Understand the client’s problem, identify the right research question, plan the methodology, corral the data, code the analysis, interpret the results, craft the deliverable, and communicate the story
Apply a research mentality: Use all tools at our disposal (documentation, policy regulations, data investigations, etc.) to make sound analytic decisions
Help the team deliver its best work: Turn direction from clients/senior staff into tactical plans and work closely with data analysts to help them implement (conducting code reviews, teaching/reinforcing analytic strategies, etc.)
This role will be a good fit for people who naturally push towards progress and are undeterred when that requires a lot of effort or stepping into unfamiliar territory. Emendata is growing rapidly, and we are looking for people who are excited to march forward together.
Qualifications: If you do not meet all the criteria below but still think you would be a good fit for this role, please apply so we can see if we can find the right spot for you on the team. We value experience but also welcome aptitude and enthusiasm.
Education: Bachelor’s or master’s degree in a quantitative field or equivalent technical training

Technical Mentorship: Demonstrated experience with reviewing code and providing feedback
Data Management: Comfortable with the process of importing, cleaning, and preparing data for analysis in a reproducible way
Analysis: Exceptional problem-solving skills with a good understanding of statistical/social science research methods; 4+ years hands-on experience in an analytics role (e.g., economic consulting)
Working Style: Intellectually curious (keep pulling on threads until finding an answer), enterprising (eager to tackle the unknown and find a way to make things happen), and collaborative (work with others to explore, build, tear down, and build again)
To be considered for this position, applicants must have the ability to work in the U.S. without a need for current or future visa sponsorship.
About the Interview Process: We want both sides to learn what it would be like to work together. Part way through the interview process, we incorporate a lightweight at-home exercise that serves as the basis for a technical interview.
