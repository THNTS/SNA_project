By building entirely new services and maintaining/iterating on our existing infrastructure, you will be a key player in our engineering journey as we raise the bar for the whole financial ecosystem

We always aim to empower our engineers and this means using the best tools for the job.

Our technology stack
Our go-to programming languages for backend services are C# and Python, but we use other technologies when the challenge we are working on calls for it (Golang and Rust);
Most of our data pipelines currently use Python, Spark and Hive, sometimes orchestrated with Airflow (but often glued together with BASH);
Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes, hosted in AWS;
Monitoring using a combination of the ELK stack, Jaeger, and Prometheus/Grafana.

Optimise our engineering processes and ultimately, our products;
Contribute to our culture, and help make sure TrueLayer remains an exceptional place to work;
Voluntary On-Call Duty

While being on call is a fantastic learning experience, we understand being on call out of hours is not for everyone, so at TrueLayer it’s voluntary. If interested, you can train with, and join, our on-call rota, which will involve compensated rotations of:
Being On-Call to respond to critical incidents affecting the availability of our platform;
Identifying, mitigating and resolving root causes of such incidents;
Coordinating our response to potentially major incidents, and being an active voice in postmortem/root cause analysis discussions to prevent future problems.

Our Government client are recruiting for a Platofmr and Automation Engineer to wokr on a large sclae Ontology Project.

The project:
To date we have built our Ontology through extensive engagement with our wider business, and review of our own literature. The existing toolset- Stanford University's WebProtégé online platform- is relatively good at allowing experienced users to build .owl ontology files. However, ontologies quickly become sizeable and dense as entities and relationships are added, and WebProtégé provides only limited functionality to help users visualise, filter, or explore parts of the ontology. This limits the usefulness of the ontology to the business. It makes the outputs inaccessible to non-technical users, which limits our ability to review and develop the ontology in collaboration with the wider organisation. It also limits the usefulness of the ontology for the purposes of system design, by preventing solution architectures from quickly visualising the subset of the ontology that is relevant to a particular project or solution. Finally, whilst WebProtégé is, as the name suggests, web-based, it is an academic product, placing necessary constraints on the speed of the solution, making access to the ontology somewhat clunky, and meaning that or work is dependent on the on-going funding of a project by a foreign academic institution.

Current situation:

We have made substantial investment in our data management infrastructure using the Microsoft Azure cloud. This has included development of an ontology and methodology for data architecture.

What's in it for me?

The aim is for Infinity Works to help broaden your skills and allow you to become more of a technology polyglot, excited to learn new technologies and techniques across the full technical stack and product life cycle.

Above all, you can deliver secure, reliable and performant platforms. And understand the difference between engineering and over-engineering.

Management of modern messaging and database components such as RabbitMQ and MYSQL
Experience of engineering enterprise services, ideally in multiple industries.
Experience of working in a team with a DevOps culture surrounded by lean / agile delivery methodologies.
These would be great too, but aren't essential:
Experience with other development languages such as Go, Python Node.js, scripting language such as Bash and PHP would also be beneficial.
Log management and analysis solutions such as ELK stack, loggly, Splunk, Sumo Logic and monitoring tools such as Zabbix, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus or similar.

Yellowbrick is well funded having raised $173m from top-tier venture firms.

We're a driven R&D team, solving hard-core computer science problems at all levels of the stack.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer, you'll contribute high-quality code to Palantir Gotham or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed at the most important institutions across the public and private sectors. You'll build features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world.

Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers, each focusing on a specific aspect of a product. For example, you might be part of a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage movement among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product.

Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle - from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution, and shipping. As a Software Engineer, you'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them. We think the best way to understand what our users need is to meet them, so occasionally you'll tour the assembly line at an auto manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and their pain points.

SWE principles include:

• Dedication: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.
• Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other Product Managers, Designers and Product Reliability Engineers. We also partners with our business development teams (Forward Deployed Engineers, Deployment Strategists) in order to understand and solve our customers' problems.
• Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities, and don't micromanage. We want to give people the space to think for themselves.

Technologies We Use

It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers who bring diverse experience — startup founders, industry veterans, university TAs, and more — you'll build your skillset to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use:

• A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front end
• Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and Redux
• Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github
Requirements
Strong engineering background in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, and Physics.
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.
Strong coding skills with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages.
Ability to collaborate and empathize with a variety of individuals. You can iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how your technical decisions impact them.
Demonstrated ability to learn and work independently and make decisions with minimal supervision.

CORONAVIRUS UPDATE: Hiring at Made Tech continues as usual. Our team are now all working remotely so all interviews will be facilitated remotely too. Hopefully, this will still be a good experience for candidates. (feedback welcome)
We're even set up to onboard any new starters remotely should we need to. All our projects are set up to continue remotely as well :)

---------------------------

Salary range is £71-90k per annum plus a range of excellent benefits. Apply below.

Our Lead Engineers lead teams to deliver digital, data and technology outcomes that improve society. They do this by establishing and leading teams to deliver software in public sector organisations.

What does the job entail?

We primarily write and deliver custom software for the public sector. We work across central and local government, as well as in health, and our past lies in the technology startup world. Technical excellence for us isn’t about delivering to feature lists. We place a strong emphasis on outcome-based delivery; ensuring our customer’s goals are understood and achieved with the technology we deploy.

Lead Software Engineers combine technical excellence, drive to deliver, and coaching, to achieve outcomes for our customers and their users, and to establish strong engineering cultures within our customer's organisations. They find themselves working on a variety of different problems from monoliths to microservices, upskilling colleagues and customers, always finding themselves learning from others, while constantly striving to be nice humans :)

Depending on our customers' needs our Lead Software Engineers may play one or more roles. Sometimes the role is very hands-on and you'll be the most senior engineer on the team delivering software, other times you will play more of a technical architect within a single team.

We need flexible individuals who enjoy a varied workload, are happy to switch between being more and less hands-on, but don't see themselves stepping away from code any time soon. It might be that you're stronger as a Tech Lead or as a Tech Architect, or only have experience in one area, that's okay as long as you have an interest and willingness to broaden your expertise.

Our teams have used Ruby with Rails and Sinatra, ES6 with React and Angular 2, C# with .NET Core. We don’t limit ourselves as a company and we expect all our Engineers to be keen on learning new technologies. Automation is important to our teams, so we make sure there is a CD pipeline set up to build, test, and release many times per day.

High performing software delivery teams need to be empowered to iteratively and rapidly deliver changes all the way through to production. To do this we combine our extensive cloud automation knowledge with DevOps culture.

We've been using AWS from the start and as Advanced Partners are go-to experts within the public sector. We use a range of IaaS, PaaS and FaaS depending on the needs of our users, in this case, software teams, such as EC2, Lambda, ECS, Kubernetes, Heroku, CloudFoundry, Azure App Services, and more. We use VPC and PrivateLink for connecting to on-premise, legacy systems. We also use API Gateway, S3, CloudFront, SQS, SNS, SES, RDS, and many other services provided by AWS.

We ensure we document our architecture and infrastructure as code, using technologies such as Terraform and OpenAPI. Containerisation is a big part of empowering our teams to develop, deploy and scale their applications, but so too is using AWS Lambda and avoiding the complexity of stateful services altogether. The right tool for the job.

For us, DevOps is about culture rather than roles and titles. Even though this role is for someone with strong DevOps experience, the biggest impact you will have is coaching and helping teams use the platforms you build. You won't be building infrastructure in isolation or charged with deploying other peoples work into production. You'll empower teams with the mantra: you build it, you run it!

We grow a team of polyglot programmers, which you might already consider yourself to be, who are versed in a mix of paradigms such as object-oriented, functional, declarative, event-based and aspect-oriented. To create this environment our Senior Engineers need to embrace sharing their knowledge and skills with others, and they need to keep an open mind – we’d love to hear some examples of mentoring, coaching and growing team members. Maybe you will have written some blog posts about your discipline, or perhaps even delivered a talk or two.

At GoCardless, we're passionate about payments. Our vision is to provide businesses with the best way to collect recurring payments, wherever they and their customers are in the world.

Today, we help over 55,000 businesses take the pain out of getting paid, so they can focus on what they do best. And through our partnerships with over 200 software providers such as Xero, Zuora, Salesforce and Quickbooks, more and more businesses are benefiting from our unique global payments platform every day. We process $15bn of payments a year across more than 30 countries, powering recurring payments for businesses worldwide, from multinational corporations to small businesses.

We're headquartered in the UK, and backed by some of the world's leading investors including Google Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, Balderton Capital, Accel Partners and Notion Capital. Over 400 employees worldwide have decided to develop their careers with us. We've built a friendly, collaborative culture where we hire and develop people who share our desire to do work we can be proud of. We value learning and feedback, and support colleagues to develop in their role and more broadly in their career.

Site Reliability Engineering at GC

As a Site Reliability Engineer you'll be part of a small team that sets the direction of the GoCardless core stack. You'll think through the moving pieces that make up our infrastructure and the complex interactions between them. You'll work with every other team within engineering – from product to data – to help build and scale the global platform our product sits on.

We take pride in our work, and open-source as much as we can. We've picked some examples of recent open-source work you can use to understand our remit, along with real-world examples of how our team operate from GitHub discussions:
Kubernetes extensions: We run a lot of our workloads in Kubernetes, and have extended our clusters with a suite of operators that we open-source at gocardless/theatre. We recently added support for authorised consoles, providing developers across GoCardless with a tool to securely administer and debug their application from within a production environment. See the PRs for this feature here.
HA Postgres tooling: GoCardless prefers Postgres for applications that need relational databases. We run large HA Postgres clusters using a tool called Stolon. Our SRE team built an extension for Stolon called stolon-pgbouncer which can provide zero-downtime failover between Postgres primaries, along with first-class integration with PgBouncer, a common Postgres connection pooler
Ensuring service reliability: As SREs, we work to ensure the reliability of our services. We recently upgraded our larger Postgres clusters to use the latest Postgres version on more powerful hardware. To ensure this change went smoothly, we wrote a load testing tool for Postgres called pgreplay-go that we used to replay production queries, helping us discover performance regressions. We also wrote a blog post about it.
About You

We use a large list of technologies and we will not expect you to have experience with all of them. We expect you to be enthusiastic about the infrastructure space, and the impact your work can have on others. To enjoy this work, we need you to be excited about learning new technologies and not afraid to tackle hard problems.

Ideally there's a programming language you've become proficient in, and used it to build a project you're proud of. We don't mind what language this is, as long as you're up to joining a team that focuses mostly on Go/Ruby. We'll probably ask you about this during the interview - we'd love to hear what you've done!

Finally, you take pride in your work and aim to build solutions that solve real problems, as simply as possible. You appreciate (and try to build!) tools that are easy to understand and run with minimal effort. You want to work with people who share these values, and will continually push you to improve. You value receiving and giving feedback, and trust in your team.

Technologies (not exhaustive, subject to change!)

For much of your time, you'll be building software in Go and Ruby. We manage our cloud resources with Terraform, our VMs with Chef, and our Kubernetes configuration with Jsonnet. You'll also help run Postgres and MySQL databases, Elasticsearch, Vault, Prometheus, and a whole host of Google Cloud products like Pub/Sub, BigQuery and GKE.

You'll rely on:
Your fluency in one or more programming languages, and writing clean and effective code
Your ability to build reliable and well tested infrastructure on top of cloud computing systems
Your experience in designing, analysing, and troubleshooting distributed systems
Your knowledge of Unix fundamentals and TCP/IP networking
It's useful, but not essential to have:
Experience managing Kubernetes environments
Experience in relational databases and other stores, especially around optimising their performance
Life at GoCardless

Diversity is hugely important to us and we welcome applications from those with disabilities and from under-represented backgrounds. Throughout our hiring and onboarding process we make any reasonable adjustments necessary to create a level playing field and continually look at how we can improve in this area. We also have active 'employee resource groups' (such a BEAM and Rainbow) that are supported and sponsored by members of our Exec team; they work to engage and inspire our employees on diversity & inclusion topics throughout the year.

We offer flexible working hours and remote working arrangements, enhanced parental leave and pension packages. You'll also receive equity, because we believe having this 'buy in' is a vital part of building a successful business where everybody - regardless of their role - can make a valuable contribution.

The COVID-19 pandemic has seen everybody at GoCardless shift to remote working and this is something we'll continue to do into 2021. We continually review this approach in conjunction with the changing restrictions in each of our locations; additionally we offer support to maintain wellbeing and comfort, including subsidised home office equipment, workstation assessments and a range of remote social activities you can dip in and out of whenever you fancy.

We value learning and feedback, and support colleagues to develop in their role and more broadly in their career.

Site Reliability Engineering at GC

As a Site Reliability Engineer you'll be part of a small team that sets the direction of the GoCardless core stack. You'll think through the moving pieces that make up our infrastructure and the complex interactions between them. You'll work with every other team within engineering – from product to data – to help build and scale the global platform our product sits on.

We take pride in our work, and open-source as much as we can. We've picked some examples of recent open-source work you can use to understand our remit, along with real-world examples of how our team operate from GitHub discussions:
Kubernetes extensions: We run a lot of our workloads in Kubernetes, and have extended our clusters with a suite of operators that we open-source at gocardless/theatre. We recently added support for authorised consoles, providing developers across GoCardless with a tool to securely administer and debug their application from within a production environment. See the PRs for this feature here.
HA Postgres tooling: GoCardless prefers Postgres for applications that need relational databases. We run large HA Postgres clusters using a tool called Stolon. Our SRE team built an extension for Stolon called stolon-pgbouncer which can provide zero-downtime failover between Postgres primaries, along with first-class integration with PgBouncer, a common Postgres connection pooler
Ensuring service reliability: As SREs, we work to ensure the reliability of our services. We recently upgraded our larger Postgres clusters to use the latest Postgres version on more powerful hardware. To ensure this change went smoothly, we wrote a load testing tool for Postgres called pgreplay-go that we used to replay production queries, helping us discover performance regressions. We also wrote a blog post about it.
About You

We use a large list of technologies and we will not expect you to have experience with all of them. We expect you to be enthusiastic about the infrastructure space, and the impact your work can have on others. To enjoy this work, we need you to be excited about learning new technologies and not afraid to tackle hard problems.

Ideally there's a programming language you've become proficient in, and used it to build a project you're proud of. We don't mind what language this is, as long as you're up to joining a team that focuses mostly on Go/Ruby. We'll probably ask you about this during the interview - we'd love to hear what you've done!

Finally, you take pride in your work and aim to build solutions that solve real problems, as simply as possible. You appreciate (and try to build!) tools that are easy to understand and run with minimal effort. You want to work with people who share these values, and will continually push you to improve. You value receiving and giving feedback, and trust in your team.

Technologies (not exhaustive, subject to change!)

For much of your time, you'll be building software in Go and Ruby. We manage our cloud resources with Terraform, our VMs with Chef, and our Kubernetes configuration with Jsonnet. You'll also help run Postgres and MySQL databases, Elasticsearch, Vault, Prometheus, and a whole host of Google Cloud products like Pub/Sub, BigQuery and GKE.

You'll rely on:
Your fluency in one or more programming languages, and writing clean and effective code
Your ability to build reliable and well tested infrastructure on top of cloud computing systems
Your experience in designing, analysing, and troubleshooting distributed systems
Your knowledge of Unix fundamentals and TCP/IP networking
It's useful, but not essential to have:
Experience managing Kubernetes environments
Experience in relational databases and other stores, especially around optimising their performance
Life at GoCardless

Diversity is hugely important to us and we welcome applications from those with disabilities and from under-represented backgrounds. Throughout our hiring and onboarding process we make any reasonable adjustments necessary to create a level playing field and continually look at how we can improve in this area. We also have active 'employee resource groups' (such a BEAM and Rainbow) that are supported and sponsored by members of our Exec team; they work to engage and inspire our employees on diversity & inclusion topics throughout the year.

We offer flexible working hours and remote working arrangements, enhanced parental leave and pension packages. You'll also receive equity, because we believe having this 'buy in' is a vital part of building a successful business where everybody - regardless of their role - can make a valuable contribution.

The COVID-19 pandemic has seen everybody at GoCardless shift to remote working and this is something we'll continue to do into 2021. We continually review this approach in conjunction with the changing restrictions in each of our locations; additionally we offer support to maintain wellbeing and comfort, including subsidised home office equipment, workstation assessments and a range of remote social activities you can dip in and out of whenever you fancy.

Current banking systems don't let us send, spend or receive money across borders easily. Or quickly. Or cheaply.

So, we're building a new one.

And, we're looking for a Site Reliability Engineer to join our Security Product team in London, who is responsible for the global security features of the TransferWise products.

For our customers, using TransferWise should feel as simple as sending a text message. Yet behind our app and website lies a complex, one-of-a-kind engine of currencies and routes that's being designed, built and powered by our talented teams in cities around the world. With new capabilities being built every day, there's still a lot to figure out, and we can't do it alone. This role is a unique opportunity to have an impact on TransferWise's mission, grow as a product leader and help save millions more people money.

The Security Product team is responsible for user authentication, security settings management, account recovery and more. Without these services being robust and resilient to failure, it means customers cannot even access TransferWise's products. We want to deliver sustainable solutions for product teams, with a healthy dose of paranoia knowing how complex, distributed systems can fail.

Here's how you'll be contributing to the Engineering Team
You will be working hands-on as an SRE, but embedded with the Security Product team responsible for the authentication and authorization of our customers. It means making tradeoffs when it comes to convenience and security, as well as availability and consistency of this crucial access layer.
We expect knowledge of OAuth2, user and potentially, service-to-service security, especially how it scales in a reliable manner. Security Product is not the only team that has implemented the Authn+Authz domains, but important to collaborate and be able to take an architectural view of these approaches and services. This means monitoring, observability and testing are fundamental when it comes to talking problems and solutions.
Is that you?
Strong experience in Java, Spring Boot/Framework/configuration, especially in designing and implementing libraries and frameworks
Experience with authentication/authorization domains and frameworks, e.g. OAuth2.0, SAML
Knowledge of security best practices and working on vulnerabilities with a bug bounty program
Experience with microservices, Docker containerisation and Kubernetes
Basic sysadmin skills in debugging issues with disk, network, app/JVM performance etc
Will not settle at all for downtime and outages, do not want to be woken up in the middle of the night
Nice to Have
Good knowledge of relational (RDBMS) and NoSQL databases
Experience with building out scalable and automated Cloud platforms on preferably AWS
Knowledge and an eye on newer architectural concepts such as microservices, service mesh, observability
Have clear understanding of the test pyramid, including end-to-end functional and/or load tests at scale
Experience with advanced release and change management processes
Key Areas of the role;
Define and create standard operating procedures that are compliant and auditable
Ownership of mission-critical shared infrastructure - run, maintain and schedule upgrades
Isolation of environments and work with various engineering teams to figure out how to best suit their needs
Sees failover and DR events as something that needs to happen with regularity and should be seamless
Engage regularly with our blameless postmortem culture, always focused on continuous improvement

187,Cloud System Engineer,London,Principal Security Engineer,-1,"CloudFactory is scaling up and growing fast, with $78 million in venture capital investment and offices on four continents. We’re looking for talented people to join us on our mission as we earn, learn, and serve our way to becoming leaders worth following.

As we continue to scale we are seeking a Principal Security Engineer to be responsible for ensuring that all the software built and integrated by CloudFactory exhibits the appropriate security characteristics for deployment in a large-scale cloud-native architecture. It is also their responsibility to create a culture of security-mindedness in CloudFactory’s engineering team.

Key Responsibilities:
Overall ownership of the protecting the platform from external security threats
Translating regulatory and compliance into specific technical policies, patterns and requirements that can be applied by engineers to all development activities and stories.
Consultant to engineers and architects when designing new components.
Responsibility for understanding existing and emerging threat vectors, attacks and the techniques and technologies to mitigate them.
Ownership of the process for identifying and correcting security flaws in third party products and libraries used on the platform
Supporting Client Technology Solutions and Sales
Promoting security-related skills and mindset in Platform Engineering and establishing security-related career paths and best practices.
Acting as a consultant on Internet security issues to any team or department that needs
Creation and maintenance of best practice, policy and how-tos for the Platform Engineering team
Leading real-time response teams during attacks or breaches
Leading investigations after attacks or breaches
Reviewing the security status of existing technologies and architectures
Performance Objectives:

1. Assess and report on the state of CloudFactory’s existing software platform and development processes. During the first six weeks, work with all members of the Platform Engineering, Product Development and Enterprise IT teams to understand and report on the exposure (or otherwise) of CloudFactory’s existing software to security and data protection risks and how the development processes and culture have led to the current state.

2. Understand CloudFactory’s regulatory and compliance obligations. CloudFactory is a complex entity with employees, workers and clients from many different countries. CloudFactory also voluntarily submits to various compliance and certification programmes. Within two months of starting, the Principal Security Engineer will need to understand the implications of these obligations on security and data protection within the CloudFactory platform.

3. Adapt product and software development processes to embed security consciousness. Once the above objectives have been met, work closely with the Directors of Engineering and Product Development to implement changes to our development processes to ensure that requirements for data protection and security are always appropriately considered during the development process.

4. Design generic run-books and policies for security. CloudFactory follows a ‘technical policy’ driven approach to governance with policies that provide specific guidance to developers to avoid the same questions being revisited in every development story. Within three months of starting, it is expected that the Principal Security Engineer will have produced policies that engineers will be able to apply to all new software.

5. Perform and document a gap analysis. Once the above objectives are complete, re-analyse the existing CloudFactory platform and provide recommendations on how to either bring deployed software up to standard, to re-write that software or to sunset it. As part of this exercise a formal analysis of the risks CloudFactory continues to run with the platform in its current state should be produced.

6. Define security roles and career path. Once the above objectives are complete, work with the Director of Engineering to define the security related roles required by CloudFactory engineering and how CloudFactory should recruit into, or develop existing staff, into those roles.

Requirements

Essential:
Designing policies and solutions for web-facing AWS hosted platforms
Understanding of low-level Internet and networking technologies as they relate to security (e.g. SSL/TLS, HTTP, WAFs, TCP/IP firewalls etc)
Leading the work of external security agencies when they are assessing or testing the platform
Translating regulatory and/or compliance requirements to implementable policies and requirements for development teams
Leadership of teams delivering security tools, processes and solutions for internal customers
Bachelor / Undergraduate degree in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Engineering, or any other technology related field
Beneficial:
Mentoring and training of engineers to create a culture of security awareness
Experience of responding to a major attack or breach
Formal qualifications/certifications in security-related disciplines
A software development, systems-engineering or DevOps background
Applying security requirements to software procurement processes

At Cisco Umbrella (née OpenDNS) we provide best-in-class DNS based services globally to internal and external customers. As part of Cloud Infrastructure Engineering we build DNS as infrastructure, offer network security services and operate as a business within Cisco. By working in lock-step with engineering, we enable businesses to securely innovate and protect them from existing and emerging threats.

What we use


The team here are currently working with Debian, AWS and Ansible (for configuration); if you have experience with these (or similar) technologies, that would be a plus.

What you’ll be doing


We are looking for engineers with experience running large, distributed systems both on bare metal and on cloud services (bonus points for Amazon Web Services.) Our systems process 250+ BILLION transactions per day. You will work along side our current development, system engineering, and performance teams to understand the current architecture and moving pieces. We own these applications end-to-end; architecture, software development, infrastructure and the operational component. The challenges can be significant. At times, it may mean rewriting or refactoring of an application in order to automate everything and remove human dependency.

We are committed to getting it done... properly, the first time.

Who you are


To join the team, you are going to want a background in Linux/BSD systems and operation. While it would be great if you already know something about the DNS, as long as you have a basic understanding and willingness to learn, we are always happy to teach new team members the ropes. We also want to know that you've been responsible for time sensitive, mission critical systems with a high attention to detail. Our services are the heart of the Cisco Umbrella product, and we take ownership of that very seriously -- our internal and external SLOs are high. You have demonstrated all the necessary skills to build and run these systems over the course of your career -- this isn’t your first rodeo.

Why Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Our mission is to reduce food waste and we've committed to cutting down the plastic in our boxes by 50% by the end of the year, this is one of the larger projects the team are working on at the moment.

Join us and let’s dream big and deliver bigger. Unbox possibility.

The Opportunity

The code we write powers every aspect of our business from the menu recommendation engine to driving our supply chain. We are a scale up business on a steep growth trajectory, and with that comes the need to build a platform that can scale. In parallel to this, we need to expand our team, evolving effective tools and processes that ensure we can continue to deliver quality code at pace.

Our platform is entirely cloud-based, and many of our backend services are now delivered via AWS Lambda. Our continuous delivery pipeline is fully automated and we release code to production multiple times a day. We’re in the process of moving our microservices architecture to containers.

Your skills and experience will help us move to the next level. We know we’ve got lots of things right but we also have many things still to improve. Right now we’re working on creating robust seed data for testing and flexible developer environments for coding.

We are making huge investments in technology, and plan to triple the size of our team to over 200 people in the next few years. As well as providing lots of career growth for our team, there will be plenty of opportunities to lead, mentor, influence and learn.

What’s it really like to work here?
We are customer-centric, data-driven and outcome-focused, using lean principles to work iteratively, experiment and learn fast.
We work in cross-functional squads which we are slowly evolving to include business partners. This allows us to work more closely with our colleagues in food, operations and marketing, enabling greater alignment, collaboration and innovation.
Our squads have a high level of autonomy to decide both what outcomes they should pursue and how they will achieve them.
We believe in being agile rather than committing to a single framework. We have a set of lean and agile principles which we follow, but beyond that squads are empowered and encouraged to tailor their working processes.
We discourage pigeon-holing which means our engineers are responsible for designing, writing, testing, deploying and maintaining their code in production. We don’t have QAs, and our architect works closely with squads to consult and collaborate.
A DevOps culture is central to our way of working and our squads are responsible for running their solutions in production.
Pairing and TDD are practices we champion and want to keep improving.
10% of our time is dedicated to tech innovation and we hold regular brown bags.
We are committed to being involved in the wider tech community, hosting meetups, speaking at events and sharing learnings via our blog.
Requirements

What skills and experience will you need?
Coaching and mentoring other engineers.
Deep knowledge of a high-level programming language - but it doesn’t need to be a language that we use here. Great engineers learn quickly and are keen to adopt new languages.
Designing and delivering scalable, distributed, cloud-based systems in a highly available manner.
Working with async and event-driven architectures.
Experience of CI/CD tooling and responsibly running solutions in production, working with logging, monitoring and alerting stacks.
A good understanding of lean product discovery and delivery practices.
What we look for in a great Lead Engineer

Great engineering - and this is so much more than writing great code. As well as an excellent knowledge of software craftsmanship, you’ll have a test-first approach and know what automated testing to apply at which level of the stack. You’ll have great design and architectural knowledge and plenty of experience of maintaining your code in production.

Leadership and Coaching - you are highly proactive, you take ownership of problems and propose solutions. You create forums to drive good principles and practices across all of engineering. You mentor and coach all levels of engineering using your knowledge and experience to drive improvements across the team.

Outcome-focus - you develop a deep understanding of the problem you’re solving before you build it. You are product-oriented and customer-focused, balancing technical direction with business value. You know when to compromise and when not to.

Lean delivery - you deliver rapidly in small batches, reducing risk and creating a fast feedback loop. You have a continuous improvement mindset, constantly seeking to reduce waste and avoid re-work.

Growth mindset - you are curious and are always looking to learn. You encourage a culture of learning, emphasising the importance of breadth as well as depth of knowledge. You value feedback as a learning tool, and you offer constructive feedback with empathy.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) build creative technical solutions to our customers' hardest problems. An internship as an FDSE is an opportunity to gain rare insight into the world's most important institutions and industries, and to grow more quickly than you imagined you could while improving the world around you. Organizations often come to us with nebulous questions, like “Why has our assembly line slowed down?” or “How can we find money launderers financing terrorism?” You'll dive deep into domains such as intelligence, energy, health, and finance, learn from experts in these fields about the problems they face and the tradeoffs they must consider in order to solve them, and lead the process of finding answers.

As an FDSE, you'll be part of a small team of fellow FDSEs and Deployment Strategists supporting a single customer in the government or commercial space. You'll make decisions about how to take on the challenges your customer poses, from the nature of the data to the user population to the legacy system environment. You'll also have the resources of a large company behind you — namely, software built and maintained by hundreds of Software Engineers who build scalable, reliable platforms for you to customize and extend.

You'll start by unpacking a problem and learning about the customer's data, then move to high-level system design and prototyping. Then you'll be ready to deploy Palantir software, develop custom applications, and integrate the data. Along the way, you'll collaborate with technical and non-technical individuals - from Palantir and from our customers - to define and achieve goals. You'll iterate with customer users and stakeholders on a rapid cadence. You'll also work with Palantir's Product Development team on the roadmaps for our core products.

FDSE principles include:

• Dedication: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.
• Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems.
• Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities—we don't micromanage. We want to give people the space to think for themselves.

Technologies We Use

With Palantir products as your baseline, you will leverage any technology you need to drive impact. It doesn't matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can pick new languages up quickly as solving the problems you'll face may require expanding your skillset. And if what you need doesn't exist yet? Go build it.

We use:

• Core Palantir products, which provide the foundations for our deployments
• Custom applications built on top of core Palantir platforms
• Postgres, Cassandra, Hadoop, and Spark for distributed data storage and parallel computing
• Java and Groovy for our back-end applications and data integration tools
• Typescript, React, Leaflet, and d3 for our web technologies
• Python for data processing and analysis
• Palantir cloud infrastructure based on AWS EC2 and S3
Requirements
Strong engineering background; preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, or Physics.
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.
Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages.
Ability to collaborate and empathize with a variety of individuals. You can iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how your technical decisions impact them.
Demonstrated ability to learn and work independently and make decisions with minimal supervision.
Willingness and interest to travel to other Palantir offices and/or client sites as needed.

We’re home to 5,000 phenomenal small creative businesses that we are proud to call our Partners, and now, more than ever, this community needs our support. So we’re doing everything we can to highlight these dynamic entrepreneurs, waving the flag for small businesses, and generally championing their socks off.

The last six months has seen big progress and investment in our data and tech teams and platforms. In Data, we’ve collaboratively defined a company wide strategy which, as part of it, aims to transform the way business users make data driven decisions through a combination of self-serve technologies and training/coaching, and we’ve significantly increased the number of analysts and engineers to make sure we can deliver on it.

We have a modern ELT analytics tech stack that we’re always looking to evolve, with Airflow for orchestration, Stitch for loading/data consolidation, a Snowflake data warehouse, DBT for transformations and Tableau for data visualization. DBT Cloud is next on the list of coming enhancements and data visualisation is up next for review.

We are now looking to build on this momentum to drive our business to the next level through better use of data, and that’s where you come in.

What we need

Reporting into our Business Intelligence Engineering Manager, you will help revamp our analytical data models, level up our reporting capabilities, and provide training and guidance to business users.

Some of the things you’ll be doing

So that business users are able to make decisions more quickly and in a data driven manner, we’re shifting to a self-service reporting paradigm. We also want to improve the architecture of our database to increase the ease with which analysts can extract and interrogate data. You’ll help us achieve these goals by:

- Designing and building reusable data components/models in our existing analytical data platform (Snowflake + DBT)
- Training/coaching self-serve reporting business users in data manipulation, aggregation, and visualisation.

We’re aiming to create a single source of truth for all consumers of analytical data (business users, analysts, data scientists). By designing and building data integrity tests at each stage in the ELT process, you’ll ensure that Data’s stakeholders are getting a correct and complete view of the business metrics.

You’ll also collaborate with the Executive, Leadership, and other operational teams to design, build, and iterate on reporting interfaces, alerting systems, and other technologies in the data presentation layer.

Experience and skills you’ll need...
Proven experience with database modelling methodologies (e.g. Kimball, Inmon, or Data Vault)
Proven experience writing data transformations (DBT, Talend, Power BI, Airflow etc.) preferably in an ELT paradigm
Proven experience working with high-performance columnar cloud data warehouses (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)
Expertise in data visualisation/reporting (ideally Tableau or Looker) with demonstrable experience across a range of business areas
Great communication skills with the ability to build good relationships across a business
Highly diligent with unwavering attention to detail
…and some other skills & experience that would be a bonus
Experience architecting analytical databases
Experience transforming data specifically with DBT or DBT Cloud
Experience with defining and creating semantic layers for reporting tools such as Looker, Power BI, Qlik etc.
Experience working in a data engineering or data warehousing team
Our perks

It’s important to us that our people are well looked after, which is why we offer everyone BUPA healthcare, life insurance and a pension plan. Because having a break is important for your physical and mental wellbeing, our holiday allowance is 25 days (plus bank holidays) AND your entitlement increases an extra day for every 2 years you spend with us.

The team spirit at NOTHS House is legendary, and while we all miss the in-office massages, hair cuts and the abundance of free fruit, we’ve taken to our virtual world with gusto and bring the team together regularly for online socials!

We endeavour to support our people to make sure work….well, works for them. And the pretty big issue of the recent global pandemic has propelled us into working more flexibly than ever before. With the office closed until further notice (at least until government social distancing advice has changed), we’re using the lessons learnt over this period to evolve our approach to flexible working whilst ensuring we all still get together as one #teamnoths

Delicious recipes, precise ingredients & a dollop of adventure, delivered to your door. We have invested into our technology, data capability and our product to ensure the customer is at the heart of what we do. Every aspect of our business is powered by our passion.

Whether it is innovation through our recipe development, building algorithms to optimise our recipe box journey or devising strategies to reduce plastic and food waste. All our teams play a part in our amazing growth in the UK!

Our DREAM? To be the most-loved way to eat dinner, and for every meal to leave the planet better off. Gousto is changing how people shop, cook and eat food at home. It’s an incredibly exciting time to join our team!

The Opportunity

The code we write powers every aspect of our business from the menu recommendation engine to driving our supply chain. We are a scale up business on a steep growth trajectory, and with that comes the need to build a platform that can scale. In parallel to this, we need to expand our team, evolving effective tools and processes that ensure we can continue to deliver quality code at pace.

Our platform is entirely cloud-based, and many of our backend services are now delivered via AWS Lambda. Our continuous delivery pipeline is fully automated and we release code to production multiple times a day. We’re in the process of moving our microservices architecture to containers.

Your skills and experience will help us move to the next level. We know we’ve got lots of things right but we also have many things still to improve. Right now we’re working on creating robust seed data for testing and flexible developer environments for coding.

We are making huge investments in technology, and plan to triple the size of our team to over 200 people in the next few years. As well as providing lots of career growth for our team, there will be plenty of opportunities to lead, mentor, influence and learn.

We work in cross-functional squads which we are slowly evolving to include business partners. This allows us to work more closely with our colleagues in food, operations and marketing, enabling greater alignment, collaboration and innovation.
Our squads have a high level of autonomy to decide both what outcomes they should pursue and how they will achieve them.
We believe in being agile rather than committing to a single framework. We have a set of lean and agile principles which we follow, but beyond that squads are empowered and encouraged to tailor their working processes.
We discourage pigeon-holing which means our engineers are responsible for designing, writing, testing, deploying and maintaining their code in production. We don’t have QAs, and our architect works closely with squads to consult and collaborate.
A DevOps culture is central to our way of working and our squads are responsible for running their solutions in production.
Pairing and TDD are practices we champion and want to keep improving.

Working with async and event-driven architectures.
Experience of CI/CD tooling and responsibly running solutions in production, working with logging, monitoring and alerting stacks.

Leadership and Coaching - you are highly proactive, you take ownership of problems and propose solutions. You create forums to drive good principles and practices across all of engineering. You mentor and coach all levels of engineering using your knowledge and experience to drive improvements across the team.

Outcome-focus - you develop a deep understanding of the problem you’re solving before you build it. You are product-oriented and customer-focused, balancing technical direction with business value. You know when to compromise and when not to.

Lean delivery - you deliver rapidly in small batches, reducing risk and creating a fast feedback loop. You have a continuous improvement mindset, constantly seeking to reduce waste and avoid re-work.

Growth mindset - you are curious and are always looking to learn. You encourage a culture of learning, emphasising the importance of breadth as well as depth of knowledge. You value feedback as a learning tool, and you offer constructive feedback with empathy.

How do we work?

Our consultants act as an extension of our customer’s team, embedding themselves in the environment, and adapting to our clients’ requirements and challenges, so they can develop a truly impactful and innovative solution.

We take a lot of pride in both the work we do and how we do it. We love trying new approaches, challenging the norm and we’ll never stop striving to be at our technical best. It comes naturally to both our team and the community we work within to help each other’s growth, share and elevate ideas, and meaningfully collaborate as much as possible. Our people are more than the sum of their parts!

That’s why you’ll get an unusual amount of autonomy — you’re here because you’re brilliant, so we trust you to do your role in a way that works for you. Our high-trust culture is one of the things that makes us so successful, so you do you and we’ll be over here, listening and providing support where needed.
We have two core beliefs here:
1) The very best ideas are born from a community that is collaborative, high-trust and diverse. Creating a development-led culture is key to us so we do everything we can to cultivate knowledge sharing and personal growth within our team. That means your questions never go unanswered, and there will always be someone on hand to work through a problem.

2) People are at their best when they have what they need and we’re committed to providing the best possible working environment. Vegan snacks? Slippers for the office? Want to work from another country to spend more time with your family? We got you!

Inclusion is one of our core values. We don’t discriminate by race, religion, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

Current banking systems don't let us send, spend or receive money across borders easily. Or quickly. Or cheaply.

So, we're building a new one.

And, we're looking for a Site Reliability Engineer to join our Security Product team in London, who is responsible for the global security features of the TransferWise products.

For our customers, using TransferWise should feel as simple as sending a text message. Yet behind our app and website lies a complex, one-of-a-kind engine of currencies and routes that's being designed, built and powered by our talented teams in cities around the world. With new capabilities being built every day, there's still a lot to figure out, and we can't do it alone. This role is a unique opportunity to have an impact on TransferWise's mission, grow as a product leader and help save millions more people money.

The Security Product team is responsible for user authentication, security settings management, account recovery and more. Without these services being robust and resilient to failure, it means customers cannot even access TransferWise's products. We want to deliver sustainable solutions for product teams, with a healthy dose of paranoia knowing how complex, distributed systems can fail.

Here's how you'll be contributing to the Engineering Team
You will be working hands-on as an SRE, but embedded with the Security Product team responsible for the authentication and authorization of our customers. It means making tradeoffs when it comes to convenience and security, as well as availability and consistency of this crucial access layer.
We expect knowledge of OAuth2, user and potentially, service-to-service security, especially how it scales in a reliable manner. Security Product is not the only team that has implemented the Authn+Authz domains, but important to collaborate and be able to take an architectural view of these approaches and services. This means monitoring, observability and testing are fundamental when it comes to talking problems and solutions.
Is that you?
Strong experience in Java, Spring Boot/Framework/configuration, especially in designing and implementing libraries and frameworks
Experience with authentication/authorization domains and frameworks, e.g. OAuth2.0, SAML
Knowledge of security best practices and working on vulnerabilities with a bug bounty program
Experience with microservices, Docker containerisation and Kubernetes
Basic sysadmin skills in debugging issues with disk, network, app/JVM performance etc
Will not settle at all for downtime and outages, do not want to be woken up in the middle of the night
Nice to Have
Good knowledge of relational (RDBMS) and NoSQL databases
Experience with building out scalable and automated Cloud platforms on preferably AWS
Knowledge and an eye on newer architectural concepts such as microservices, service mesh, observability
Have clear understanding of the test pyramid, including end-to-end functional and/or load tests at scale
Experience with advanced release and change management processes
Key Areas of the role;
Define and create standard operating procedures that are compliant and auditable
Ownership of mission-critical shared infrastructure - run, maintain and schedule upgrades
Isolation of environments and work with various engineering teams to figure out how to best suit their needs
Sees failover and DR events as something that needs to happen with regularity and should be seamless
Engage regularly with our blameless postmortem culture, always focused on continuous improvement

We’re looking for talented people to join us on our mission as we earn, learn, and serve our way to becoming leaders worth following.

As we continue to scale we are seeking a Principal Security Engineer to be responsible for ensuring that all the software built and integrated by CloudFactory exhibits the appropriate security characteristics for deployment in a large-scale cloud-native architecture. It is also their responsibility to create a culture of security-mindedness in CloudFactory’s engineering team.

Key Responsibilities:
Overall ownership of the protecting the platform from external security threats
Translating regulatory and compliance into specific technical policies, patterns and requirements that can be applied by engineers to all development activities and stories.
Consultant to engineers and architects when designing new components.
Responsibility for understanding existing and emerging threat vectors, attacks and the techniques and technologies to mitigate them.
Ownership of the process for identifying and correcting security flaws in third party products and libraries used on the platform

Performance Objectives:

1. Assess and report on the state of CloudFactory’s existing software platform and development processes. During the first six weeks, work with all members of the Platform Engineering, Product Development and Enterprise IT teams to understand and report on the exposure (or otherwise) of CloudFactory’s existing software to security and data protection risks and how the development processes and culture have led to the current state.

2. Understand CloudFactory’s regulatory and compliance obligations. CloudFactory is a complex entity with employees, workers and clients from many different countries. CloudFactory also voluntarily submits to various compliance and certification programmes. Within two months of starting, the Principal Security Engineer will need to understand the implications of these obligations on security and data protection within the CloudFactory platform.

3. Adapt product and software development processes to embed security consciousness. Once the above objectives have been met, work closely with the Directors of Engineering and Product Development to implement changes to our development processes to ensure that requirements for data protection and security are always appropriately considered during the development process.

4. Design generic run-books and policies for security. CloudFactory follows a ‘technical policy’ driven approach to governance with policies that provide specific guidance to developers to avoid the same questions being revisited in every development story. Within three months of starting, it is expected that the Principal Security Engineer will have produced policies that engineers will be able to apply to all new software.

5. Perform and document a gap analysis. Once the above objectives are complete, re-analyse the existing CloudFactory platform and provide recommendations on how to either bring deployed software up to standard, to re-write that software or to sunset it. As part of this exercise a formal analysis of the risks CloudFactory continues to run with the platform in its current state should be produced.

6. Define security roles and career path. Once the above objectives are complete, work with the Director of Engineering to define the security related roles required by CloudFactory engineering and how CloudFactory should recruit into, or develop existing staff, into those roles.

The team here are currently working with Debian, AWS and Ansible (for configuration); if you have experience with these (or similar) technologies, that would be a plus.

What you’ll be doing


We are looking for engineers with experience running large, distributed systems both on bare metal and on cloud services (bonus points for Amazon Web Services.) Our systems process 250+ BILLION transactions per day. You will work along side our current development, system engineering, and performance teams to understand the current architecture and moving pieces. We own these applications end-to-end; architecture, software development, infrastructure and the operational component. The challenges can be significant. At times, it may mean rewriting or refactoring of an application in order to automate everything and remove human dependency.

We are committed to getting it done... properly, the first time.

Who you are


To join the team, you are going to want a background in Linux/BSD systems and operation. While it would be great if you already know something about the DNS, as long as you have a basic understanding and willingness to learn, we are always happy to teach new team members the ropes. We also want to know that you've been responsible for time sensitive, mission critical systems with a high attention to detail. Our services are the heart of the Cisco Umbrella product, and we take ownership of that very seriously -- our internal and external SLOs are high. You have demonstrated all the necessary skills to build and run these systems over the course of your career -- this isn’t your first rodeo.

Why Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!",4.2,"Cisco Systems

Our mission is to reduce food waste and we've committed to cutting down the plastic in our boxes by 50% by the end of the year, this is one of the larger projects the team are working on at the moment.

Join us and let’s dream big and deliver bigger. Unbox possibility.

The Opportunity

The code we write powers every aspect of our business from the menu recommendation engine to driving our supply chain. We are a scale up business on a steep growth trajectory, and with that comes the need to build a platform that can scale. In parallel to this, we need to expand our team, evolving effective tools and processes that ensure we can continue to deliver quality code at pace.

Our platform is entirely cloud-based, and many of our backend services are now delivered via AWS Lambda. Our continuous delivery pipeline is fully automated and we release code to production multiple times a day. We’re in the process of moving our microservices architecture to containers.

Your skills and experience will help us move to the next level. We know we’ve got lots of things right but we also have many things still to improve. Right now we’re working on creating robust seed data for testing and flexible developer environments for coding.

We are making huge investments in technology, and plan to triple the size of our team to over 200 people in the next few years. As well as providing lots of career growth for our team, there will be plenty of opportunities to lead, mentor, influence and learn.

What’s it really like to work here?
We are customer-centric, data-driven and outcome-focused, using lean principles to work iteratively, experiment and learn fast.
We work in cross-functional squads which we are slowly evolving to include business partners. This allows us to work more closely with our colleagues in food, operations and marketing, enabling greater alignment, collaboration and innovation.
Our squads have a high level of autonomy to decide both what outcomes they should pursue and how they will achieve them.
We believe in being agile rather than committing to a single framework. We have a set of lean and agile principles which we follow, but beyond that squads are empowered and encouraged to tailor their working processes.
We discourage pigeon-holing which means our engineers are responsible for designing, writing, testing, deploying and maintaining their code in production. We don’t have QAs, and our architect works closely with squads to consult and collaborate.
A DevOps culture is central to our way of working and our squads are responsible for running their solutions in production.
Pairing and TDD are practices we champion and want to keep improving.
10% of our time is dedicated to tech innovation and we hold regular brown bags.
We are committed to being involved in the wider tech community, hosting meetups, speaking at events and sharing learnings via our blog.

We provide organisations with building block web services that allow them to innovate faster and operate their software more cost-effectively. These services-in-the-cloud include on-demand compute capacity, storage, content delivery, querying of structured data, message queuing, and more. The AWS team is building and delivering the next generation of cloud computing that supports public AWS offerings like S3, EC2, and CloudFront. We are innovating new ways of building massively scalable distributed systems.

The AWS Security team owns security for all services offered by AWS, including EC2 and S3. This creates many opportunities for cross-team collaboration and high visibility into the company. AWS Security is on the cutting edge of many security issues for a wide variety of platforms and technologies including cloud services, Internet of things (IoT), identity and access management, mobile devices, virtualisation, AI and Robotics and custom hardware, all operating at massive scale. Similarly, our highly collaborative team is committed to each team members growth as our business grows.

The genuine passion of this team drives innovation. We dive deep into security technologies to provide our customers the best possible experience. Projects include building new authentication systems, enhancing cryptography and conducting massive-scale audit analysis.

To meet the growing demand for AWS Services around the globe, we need exceptionally talented, bright, and driven people. AWS Security places a high importance on career development. We know that people are dynamic and looking to grow their skill set. For this reason, we offer workshops, encourage conference attendance and accommodate career aspirations.

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and we host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazons culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

WHAT DOES A SECURITY ENGINEER DO AT AMAZON?

We work cross-functionally to assess risk and help deliver countermeasures that protect customers and company data. What does this entail? We work with engineering teams to create solutions that solve or remediate security problems. Advising peers, managers, and senior leaders, we help influence and drive partner-team compliance (e.g., data classification, regulatory obligations, and other security goals).

A Security Engineer at Amazon is expected to be strong in multiple domains and provide significant contributions to the AWS IT Security team and to multiple groups throughout Amazon. Security engineers are expected to develop elegant solutions to complex business problems and apply appropriate technologies while following security engineering best practices. Security Engineers are also expected to mentor more junior engineers and be a security thought leader for the organisation.

A Security Engineer must foster constructive dialogue and seek resolution when confronted with discordant views. Engineers in this role are expected to participate fully in the planning of the AWS IT Security team's work and constantly seek opportunities for process improvement. They should also have a deep understanding of at least one specialty for which they are a sought out resource (both within AWS IT Security and by groups throughout Amazon), while having an understanding of the application of Information Security in a broad range of technical areas.

A successful candidate will need a combination of troubleshooting, technical, and communication skills, as well as the ability to handle a mix of disparate tasks which may include project and software development work. This role will provide career growth opportunities as you gain new security skills in the course of your duties.

Ready to shape tomorrow?

This is somewhere where innovative thinking and the power of technology know no limits. We know that the success of the business depends on the people who keep it moving, which is why we are looking for exceptional talent to join our international payments revolution.

We’re bringing simplicity, transparency & scale to cross-border payments - a $120 trillion market.

Currencycloud is levelling the playing field in Financial Services, by delivering the best cross-border Fintech platform in the world. Our Cloud Platform Engineering team is at the heart of this - come and join us!
About the role
From our monolithic datacenter beginnings, we’ve moved wholesale to AWS where our system runs as a set of distributed applications. We’re currently in the process of migrating those applications over to Kubernetes, and building new ones, as we further embrace a microservices architecture.

The primary mission of the Developer Platform Organisation is to provide a platform for our developer community, which allows a frictionless and straightforward path to a reliable production operation. Crucially this is optimised for change and is sustainable as we move forwards. The Developer Community is our main customer and as such an important part of our role is to provide guidance and support around how we can best leverage the platform to meet our customer’s demands. We’re looking for someone who can think about systems, their edge cases, failure modes, and life-cycles.

The principles that underpin our activities are:
A focus on the ongoing sustainable maintenance and operability of our platform
Adopting cloud-native principles and a focus upon relentless automation and testing of change
We will only operate what we absolutely must
High-quality Observability
Building a platform that is architected to handle change, be that new services, new customers, new regulations, new tooling or a change in demand
The Details
Day-to-day you’ll work with a variety of tools, technologies, capabilities and processes.
You will:
Design, build and maintain solutions that enable our development community to self serve the infrastructure and capabilities they need to build secure, scalable and reliable services and allow them to deliver them safely to production.
Support teams in their CI/CD process and encourage best practices
Contribute towards improvement initiatives - examples of such projects recently include:
Reviewing and testing various CI/CD tooling to improve stability
Implementing fully automated pipelines for the services we run as well as supplying the tools to execute various test types autonomously
Migrating services from EC2 to EKS
Multiple ongoing initiatives to improve platform performance and stability in light of the changing demands of our customers
Build a great developer experience for people using the infrastructure and platform you operate and maintain.

We rely heavily on the following tools and technologies:
AWS and its suite of products around compute, networking and storage for the vast majority of our infrastructure
Kubernetes (EKS) to schedule and run our services
Datadog to monitor our applications and infrastructure
Istio for our Service Mesh
Terraform for our infrastructure as code
Pact for our contract testing
Ideally you will be comfortable coding and scripting with a variety of languages. We don’t mind which languages you prefer, just that you can demonstrate that you are able to solve problems with code.

It’s not expected that any single candidate would have expertise across all of these areas. We are looking for folks with relevant experience who are really focused on their customers’ needs, want to solve problems and build a reliable, secure and sustainable developer platform.
Anything extra to add?
Along with a no dress code policy & flexible working arrangements we also provide all of our employees with a prepaid debit card each month to spend on Wellness, or a contribution to a gym membership.

We offer a comprehensive range of employee benefits which include 25 days paid leave, 5% pension, BUPA health insurance, life insurance, long term sickness protection, a day off for your birthday and socials every Friday.
