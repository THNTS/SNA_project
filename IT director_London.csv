4,IT director,London,Interaction Design Director,-1,"Are you ready to do your career’s best work with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pioneer a new type of experience at the intersection of physical play and technology?
Creative Play Lab (CPL), LEGO’s innovation department and origin of successful products like LEGO® Super Mario, is incubating a new (top secret) project. CPL’s mission is to create exciting new experiences which share our love of LEGO building with future generations of kids, whilst keeping play relevant for existing builders.

We are looking for a seasoned design leader to manage, challenge and inspire a highly innovative team. Equipped with extensive people leadership and interaction design experience – demonstrated through successful launches of cutting-edge products – you will re-define toys by creating magical and memorable moments that will wow kids for decades to come.

You will lead your agile team through this high-stakes, category defining project. No two days will ever be the same but here’s a snapshot of what you can expect.
Core Responsibilities
In partnership with the Toy Design Director, translate the product vision into a design direction, leading the Design teams across intuitive UX, toy and electronic interaction design.

Represent the voice of our audience – the child. You are a big kid with an understanding of the psychology of play and design for kids (experience creating play for kids, play loops, play mechanics, rewards systems and how play relates to human responses & vice versa).

Drive the user experience development process, deeply integrating design research with kids. Ensure that kids can intuitively understand the core system functions, set-up & use them seamlessly, then be surprised, delighted and inspired by the results.

Integrate Toy & Tech – champion play first but ensure the tech delivers. Represent the two on behalf of the kids, uphold our play and tech principles and use them in your decision making.

Protect the investment – help less technical members of the team understand the desirability, feasibility and viability impacts in technical trade-off discussions – ensuring solutions are fun.

Advocate to the Tech team to ensure the project delivers intuitive and productive design authoring tools, to enable design teams to work quickly and iteratively, delivering maximum play quality.

Evangelize to the LEGO Product Groups – partnering with internal stakeholders, understand the needs of the existing LEGO Product Lines and use this to inspire and guide interaction development. Convince the existing Product Lines of the play & UX value of the project.

Play your part in our team succeeding

We aim for the highest bar in innovation, and working with our internal and external partners we make sure that our innovations move smoothly into production.

The team are tackling strategically important projects designed to create new toy categories, and this complex project requires a substantial investment in technology and its success factor rests on the quality of the UX, interactions and play the technical innovation creates for kids. The Interaction Design Director takes the primary responsibility for ensuring that the system experience is easy, intuitive and playful.
Do you have what it takes?
Experience and track record are more relevant than specific education. We would love to meet applicants from diverse backgrounds.

Experience in explorative work and R&D – thrives with ambiguous, early development projects and brings organised focus to discovery phases of a project. Experienced with Agile and rapid iteration environments.
Several years of experience as a leader in a creative role – team leadership, goal-setting, people development.
Demonstrated experience in pushing boundaries beyond typical, existing play types – e.g. creating a never-before-seen type of play.
Demonstrated ability to make difficult trade-off decisions and explain reasoning to gain buy-in from the team.
An energizing and inspiring leadership style – champion your team, empower them and unlock their potential whilst pushing for the highest standards, always represent the voice of the kids in all decision making.
Pragmatic dreamer – you will be able to show projects where you created grand visions based in deep market understanding and grounded in the play needs of mainstream kids.
A challenger mindset – help evolve the broader business by role modelling new approaches and ways of working, do not accept the status quo.
Natural connector – adept at forging relationships with internal stakeholders, to evangelise the project and solicit input.
Technically literate & creatively minded – experienced with complex consumer electronics projects and software development, having lead interactive or interaction teams in a creative industry (toy, games).
Good command of project/development management tools is an advantage (e.g. Jira, Microsoft Project, Hansoft).
Experience of development tools, such as Unity and Git, is an advantage.
Advanced level of English.
The successful applicant will be asked to take part in a Child Safety Background Check.

Other Considerations
We offer a flexible approach to your primary office location, working either out of LEGO® ’s home town of Billund, Denmark, or London. There may be travel to each of the team studios from time to time, as needed by the project. As you will be leading a distributed team, the ability to lead remotely is essential.
Join the global LEGO® family
Children are our role models. Their curiosity, creativity and imagination inspire everything we do. We strive to create a diverse, dynamic and inclusive culture of play at the LEGO Group, where everyone feels safe, valued and they belong.

The LEGO Group is proud to be an equal opportunity and an affirmative action employer. We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, colour, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status.

We support our employees in being there for the moments that matter in life and celebrate families of all kinds, the loved ones that make us who we are. Being part of the LEGO Group also means taking part in our annual Play Day, playing a part in building a sustainable future and continuing our mission to “inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow.” Build your career brick by brick at the LEGO Group.

About TRGT
Not your typical agency...
We set up TRGT because we felt a lot of agencies were overcharging and underdelivering where it really mattered; there was too much emphasis on making results look good rather than actually making them good.

We offer a fast-paced, dynamic and inclusive environment where all employees can have an impact. Our people are our most important asset and you will be challenged to achieve, grow and develop.

About C Space

C Space is a multi-awarded pioneering insight and innovation consultancy with offices in Boston, New York, San Francisco, London and Tokyo. Over the years we have helped clients like Google, Samsung, Jaguar Land Rover, L'Oréal, Orange and Allianz grow by developing new products, services and communication together with their customers. Most of our clients have worked with us for a number of years and about 80% keep coming back for more every year: building long-lasting relationships with our clients is the key ingredient to our success.

Insight at C Space isn't like insight at other agencies; it's faster, more entrepreneurial and more integrated. And it doesn't just focus on finding the 'truth' but more importantly on leveraging that truth with those who matter in our clients' organisation: we truly care about and organise ourselves around having impact on our clients' business – by either making them or saving them some money.

Our Promise is to deliver Customer Inspired Growth. How we do it:
Customer As A Service: Drive customer centricity through always-on online communities underpinned by best-in-class technologies that enables you to connect data sources and plug the customers at the heart for decision making
Data & Analytics: a technology first approach to quantitative research focused on helping our clients make strategic, customer-first decisions
Insight & Foresight: Anticipate changes and create strategies that outperform the competition.
Customer Experience: Segment the market, map the journey, identify biggest drivers of growth, create solutions that delight customers across all relevant touchpoints.
Innovation: Fast-track proposition development, generate buy-in across all relevant functions and develop products and services that always win.
Customer Centricity Programs: Bring stakeholders closer to customers so they make decisions with a true customer intuition
Why do clients keep working with us?
We get to Human Truths, not just a small piece of the data puzzle: We blend reported and factual, qual and quant, new and old data to unpack real truths that you can trust, that are new, and that are useful to your business.
We are business partners, not research suppliers: We pioneered co-creation in the 90's, and it's always been our DnA: we develop solutions with, not for, so they are business-relevant, trusted and organisationally adopted.
We get to impact, real business impact - not inefficient insight metrics: We develop KPI's from the outset, and we make them ladder up to actual business outcomes (from NPS to sales). We ask our clients to hold us accountable to them – so insight stays valuable.
We are Global, not a hipster London bubble: With Offices in 4 continents, 22 languages spoken in-house, and ~90+ markets covered in the past year, we get cultural nuances, and we make logistics and technology work to increase our reach.
We pride ourselves on our friendly but high-performing culture. We love people who are self-starters, see the glass as half-full and thrive in a fast paced, entrepreneurial environment: Half of C Space management in the EMEA business started their career at C Space as entry level consultants. We tend to attract people who are curious about the world and who have been able to match this curiosity with the ability to problem-solve challenges for clients in marketing and insight departments. Ultimately, there are five traits that all our people have in common:

Ambition Collaboration Appetite to learn Resourcefulness Humour

We are passionate about our people and proud of our culture. We have six 'behaviours' to ensure that we are delivering fantastic work, continuing to learn and develop and building a high-performance culture which creates opportunities for those who work here:
I've got this: taking responsibility, doing what we say we will.
Only accept awesome: delivering high quality work that we are proud of and has impact.
Show the love: celebrating successes & ensuring everyone has a voice.
Do what scares you: challenging ourselves, taking risks and learning more.
Tell it like it is: being honest and freeing ourselves from ""office politics"" and ""hidden agendas""
Open up and listen: Listening first and fully before we respond or react
You can find out more about our culture on our culture page - https://cspace.com/culture/ and through this video - https://vimeo.com/cspacelondon/review/304868770/b2ddca64f1

50,IT director,London,Technology Director,-1,"We’re currently looking for a Technology Director to join our team in London.
Idean is a global design studio, operating in the realms of design, technology and business. At about 90 here in London, we’re a curious and caring mix of thinkers, makers and doers. We believe that companies need to transform their business of today while building their business of tomorrow. We create products, services and Beta Businesses from scratch as well as transforming things that already exist from the ground up. Idean is a part of Capgemini Invent, and some of our projects are joint efforts with our extended family and some are Idean solo teams.
Idean is a place where you can make real change at a truly enormous scale. We work with some of the biggest and most-exciting businesses across all sorts of industries – so if you care about impact, this is a place where you can make it. We’re helping clients launch Beta Businesses and challenging existing setups in Telco, Energy, Financial Services and Retail, amongst other sectors. One of these new businesses, SMARTY, recently became the best-rated mobile network on Trustpilot. Not bad for a baby business. Our team has written a bunch of articles about their work and life here at Idean over on our blog.
We take on projects of many shapes and sizes. They can be short or long, depending on the scope. And they can sometimes involve some travel to see clients and users. However right now, like most companies around the world, we’re embracing remote working. Our studio has slowly started to re-open for those who'd like to spend time there (all optional of course) but our later plan is to develop a hybrid model, where some purposeful in-person working will sit alongside continued remote working. This means that to work at Idean UK your fixed place of residence must be in or around London (although we appreciate you might be elsewhere right now).
More about the role
As a Technology Director you will define the path that Idean takes in delivering software for our clients, now and in the future. You will lead our technology teams and collaborate with the other Idean disciplines to ensure we deliver ground-breaking digital experiences to our clients. The Technology Director will play a key part in the growth of the technology offering at Idean and therefore be comfortable owning relationships with our clients.
This is a multi-faceted lead role. You will be responsible for the technology that powers these products; if it’s technical, you own it. It breaks down like this:
Technical leadership - being clear on where the technology needs to go, how it will get there, and what the benefits will be.
New feature design - work with our product managers and designers to design, scope and prioritise new features.
Stakeholder management - own relationships with our C-Level clients, becoming a trusted advisor to technical and non-technical groups alike.
Delivering value to our clients as quickly as possible. In technology terms, this means we get stuff built and shipped and into customers hands as fast.
Development and deployment methodology - how do features get planned, built and deployed? Ensuring we start projects efficiently, but with an eye on the long-term lifecycle of an enterprise-grade product.
Championing Agile best practices, DevOps culture and Continuous Delivery.
Lead, coach and support engineers - work with them to do their best work helping them along the way.
Technical quality - owning the technical backlog and technical quality of the product.
We work with a lot of different technologies. We don’t have a set stack, although we lean towards contemporary open source frameworks and cloud services that let us get stuff done quickly. You’ll play a key role in helping ensure we’ve got an eye on what trends are coming next too.
You will
Be one of our technology leaders
Lead or support with new business efforts - ensuring Technology is an integral part of the solutions we’re designing for our clients.
Be comfortable with the technology patterns used by startups and enterprise corporates and know when to choose them as appropriate with our clients.
Bring a level of commercial awareness to the team, ensuring the full cost of ownership is understood; from project inception, through to delivery with repeated iteration and enhancement.
Lead multi-disciplinary teams, spanning design to product.
Lead our internal development teams, guiding and coaching across our Technology Community of Practice - building and enhancing the careers of our team.
Be an advocate for technology excellence across all our projects, aligning the importance of user-centered feature design with the essentials of high quality code and non-functional requirements.
Be entrepreneurial in spirit, making best use of all the tools available to you, across Idean and the wider Capgemini family.
Work well with people
Translate technical decisions into non-technical language for stakeholders outside of the development team or process.
Encourage a culture of learning, sharing resources and providing reinforcement of individuals goals within the development team.
Manage the onboarding of new developers and handover when a developer leaves the team.
Provide vision not dictation of the development of the software within the business.
Encourage a culture of learning, sharing resources and providing reinforcement of individuals goals within the development team.
Encourage sharing of knowledge
Ensure a high level of documentation standards within feature development.
Refine and continually improve processes around software reviews, reduce complexity conversations into tangible documentation.
Provide where necessary technical design documentation and reference.
Reduce silos of technical knowledge of critical systems.
Lead the effort to standardise the approach to implementing our technology-stack across our clients.
You have
Demonstrable experience delivering technical projects from conception to delivery to growth.
A comprehensive technical background and experience of a wide range of modern technologies, architecture and concepts. Your specific knowledge of a particular language isn’t as important as your grasp on the pros/cons and tradeoffs each one brings.
Experience working with and championing modern approaches to building innovative products, and effective technology teams - such as Agile, Lean and/or Continuous Delivery, and Infrastructure as Code.
A contemporary attitude and approach to building innovative products and services.
The ability to represent the technology perspective to our clients at management or board level.
The ability to set the technical direction and goals on a project, create a productive working environment, and support our developers to grow.
Experience of technology renewal, digital transformation projects, data science, machine learning, managing remote teams, or technology consulting would be nice to have.
Comfort reflecting on your individual performance and behaviours and, together with feedback from others, you will actively seek to continuously improve.
Buckets of positivity and a “can do” attitude.
Don’t worry about being a 100% fit. That’s impossible nonsense, anyway. If this sounds like an interesting opportunity to you, and you think it could work, let’s chat.
What to expect from our application process
Standard stuff, really. First, if we like what we see within your application, you’ll hear from us within a couple of weeks and you’ll be invited to have a chat by video-hangout or phone with a member of our Talent team.

Do you care about the same things we do?
We have six values we work by. When we meet, we’ll want you to show us how they’re important to you, too.
Collaboration: We work together, share ideas and always make time to help each other out.
Leadership: Everyone has the chance to lead their own projects.
Excellence: Quality is central to our purpose. We love what we do, and it shows. We sweat the details. We see things through, no matter how tricky.
Agility: The world moves quickly. To keep up, we stay flexible – changing approaches, changing projects, working offline, online, together and alone to get things done.
Respect: A given, of course: we value each other and our clients. We listen, we understand, we care.
Responsibility: The decisions we make and advice we give affects people’s lives and livelihoods. We take that seriously and always do well by doing what’s right.
Share ideas and profits
Unlike most firms, we’re also a shared enterprise. So when the firm does well, everyone does well by taking home a share of the profits. Of course, to get those profits, we need to share ideas and share responsibility for our work, too.
Bring your whole self
Now you’ve seen our values, it shouldn’t be a surprise that we’re creating a respectful, open, diverse place to work. Building an inclusive culture, where we value difference and respect our colleagues, is not just the right thing to do, it helps our people to perform at the best of their ability and realise their potential.
“We are committed to making sure that the opportunities within our firm are equally accessible for everyone – regardless of background or gender.” Dave Dunckley, CEO
There’s more to life than work
Families, children, sports, night classes…the things you do and the people you’re with outside work matter. They can inspire, motivate and energise you. Inside the office and out. So if you’d like to work flexibly, let us know. We’re happy to look at flexible working options for all our roles, and we’ll always do our best to keep your work and life in balance.

93,IT director,London,CTO (Chief Technology Officer),-1,"Albus Health (registered as ‘BreatheOx Limited’) is a medical technology spinout company from the University of Oxford that develops intelligent remote monitoring systems. Within three years of forming, we have won several innovation awards, raised nearly £3 million in funding and commercialised our first product through a contract to supply to one of the world’s largest pharma companies in the respiratory space.

We are now looking for a CTO who can help make our vision of improving the lives of hundreds of millions of people around the world a reality.

What do we do and why do we do it?

Chronic respiratory conditions such as asthma and COPD are common, affecting a billion people worldwide, and are some of the leading causes of death and disability. Several billion dollars are spent each year into research and clinical trials in these conditions. However, the best tools available to monitor symptoms at home are subjective or require active engagement from the users, leading to very poor adherence and data quality. Lack of reliable tools leads to slower, costlier, and inefficient research, as well as hundreds of millions of hospital admissions which could be prevented through efficient symptom monitoring at home.

Albus Home RD, our first product, is an award-winning device that remotely monitors symptoms without anyone having to do or wear anything. With our proprietary algorithms, this enables the collection of continuous and objective data when people are at home without requiring any input or action. Being passive and plug-and-play, it is suitable for people of all ages, regardless of their technical ability or location. Moreover, it does not need any contact between two people or between the user and the device, making it ideal for the post-Covid world! Our product has exciting applications in clinical trials, and through the use of predictive analytics, in the prevention of respiratory emergencies such as asthma attacks.

Who are we?

Our team comprises industry-leading clinical, technical, and commercial experts, including the head of Respiratory Medicine at the University of Oxford, globally renowned respiratory researchers, the head of Computational Intelligence and Biomonitoring Lab at Oxford, and the former CEO of a medical technology unicorn. Our co-founders have a combined background in computer science, finance, and clinical practice. Please visit our website www.albushealth.com for more details.

What have we done so far?

We spun out of Oxford in 2017 and have since won 3 innovation awards (InnovateUK) funded by the UK government as well as the AI in Health and Care Award announced by the Secretary of State for Health and Care at the London Tech Week 2020. We commercialised our first product in 2019 to help pharmaceutical companies collect objective data in their clinical trials and secured a contract to supply our technology to a clinical study by one of the world’s largest pharma companies in the respiratory space.

What’s in it for you?

We are at an exciting stage of the company - moving from early adoption to a rapid growth phase, scaling our first product and building the next one. We are looking for a full-time CTO to join us in our offices in central Oxford (post-February 2021, until when we will be working from home).

Working in a young medtech start-up means that you will work directly with an exciting team of engineers, computer scientists, doctors and researchers who are passionate about solving one of the most enormous unmet needs in healthcare.

What will you be doing as the Chief Technology Officer?

You will be responsible for taking vital technical decisions in the company, executing them and playing an integral role in setting the company’s strategic direction, innovation and future growth. This involves working with the rest of the management team, managing the technical budget, joining conversations with external stakeholders, and liaising with the R&D, product, clinical and regulatory teams within the company. On the engineering side, you will be leading the development of hardware and software stack for existing product and architecture for new products. You will be responsible for deploying products to our clients and partners across Europe and the US. You will lead the existing team, hire new members and take a hands-on role in helping scope, architect, develop and deploy projects. Externally, you will be required to manage subcontractors, work with partners on collaboration projects and join conversations with investors.

You will be a key part of the management team that brings our vision of being the world’s best home monitoring company to life.

About Us

At Masabi, we are helping to make cities better places to live, work and visit, by enabling seamless, frictionless journeys on public transport systems. We are a technology company, developing a SaaS-based fare collection and ticketing platform that allows commuters to buy and present tickets for public transport on their mobile phones or simply by tapping a bank card to travel. With deployments to over 80 transit agencies across 4 continents, Masabi’s team has been delivering innovation to millions of riders of public transportation for over ten years.

Proving ourselves as true innovators and category leaders, we launched a ticketing SDK - a first for public transit - allowing urban mobility providers like ride-hailing (Uber), journey planners (Transit), and bike and ride-sharing services, to integrate our market-leading ticketing platform into their applications, connecting services together for a seamless user experience. Current customers of Masabi’s SDK include Uber, Transit (NA), Jorudan (Japan) and Kisio/Keolis (France).

You will have ownership for business-critical systems and contributing multi-year components to our overall roadmap.

In this role:
You are responsible for making sure your software and hardware is running properly, your customers are taken care of, your team measures and publishes core performance metrics, and also identifies and resolves defects and incidents in a timely manner.
You build multi-layer lean organisations that contain high-performance teams of Agile, cross-functional teams who deliver predictably excellent results through rapid iterations that pivot in line with evolving business needs.

You have a strong understanding of customer, business, financial, and legal requirements that ensure your products and services are successful including healthy relationships with senior management and experts across Product, Services, Business Development, HR, Legal, and Finance.
You focus on growing organisational capability – this means placing an emphasis on all aspects of the employee lifecycle (recruiting, onboarding, performance management and employee development).
You are solution-oriented and continue to move forward in the face of ambiguity and imperfect knowledge. You are willing to innovate with bold, data-driven bets and do not suffer from “analysis paralysis”.

Strong experience leading end-to-end software and hardware product delivery processes where the engineering ownership spectrum includes writing backlog user stories based on high-level product requirements, developing the product, developing automated testing for the product, deploying the product, measuring the success of the product, and being on call for resolving issues with the product.

Excellent analytical skills with clear written and oral communication capability that is successful presenting to senior management levels outside of Engineering and into the ecosystem around Masabi.
Ability to travel up to approx once per quarter for single or multi-day visits to current and possibly new sites, which could include customer visits, in a post COVID scenario.

A track record of introducing new, multi-organisational processes that improve supply chain efficiency, total cost of ownership, and/or time to market.
A track record of successfully mentoring and promoting senior managers, managers, principal engineers, hardware engineers, and technical programme managers to market validated standards.
Autonomous success communicating with markets, other supply chain partners, and senior management to collect and deliver on business, product, and engineering goals.

Created by a team of proven FinTech entrepreneurs in 2016, Vitesse PSP is an FCA regulated payments business that provides global payment services to a range of businesses. Vitesse operates one of the largest domestic banking and payment networks in the world, giving its customers direct access to more than 100 countries’ domestic payment networks, covering over 60 currencies. Through a single integration, merchants gain access to in-country payment routing, resulting in significantly lower payment costs but with a much faster (increasingly instant) and data rich delivery. To date, the company has processed over £2.1bn across almost 2.3 million transactions.

Vitesse serves customers (including Brit Insurance, Axa, DXC Technology, Gett and Visa) in four key markets:
Insurance - greater visibility and control of loss funds and improved claims settlement.
Payroll - a simplified payment process for a global workforce.
FinTech - supporting businesses expand their global reach.
Corporate/Ecommerce - greater transparency, more cost effective and faster global payments.
Of these segments Insurance is the largest in revenue terms and also the fastest growing largely as a result of success in the Lloyds of London market, where Vitesse has established itself as the market leader. Vitesse is contracted with over 60% of the Lloyds market and provides liquidity management as well as supporting claims payments.

Vitesse has raised over £15m to date and recently closed a Series A round that was led by Octopus Ventures, one of the largest VCs in Europe. Vitesse grew to £3M+ of revenue in 2019/20 and the business plan is to continue doubling revenue in each of the next three to four years.

With cross-border B2B exports expected to increase to $21T (USD) by 2023, the market opportunity is significant and Vitesse has aggressive growth plans which include establishing a presence in the US market.

We're looking for a Senior Director to join the team in this highly visible, business critical role - this is a special and unique new role for Ipsos MORI and we are looking for someone who is experienced in Consumers & Brands; who can make sense of it, and package it and deliver engagingly to clients. A Brand & Comms expert with deep knowledge of the specialism with a likely with a mix of agency & client side experience, wanting to take their career in an exciting direction, specialising in this type of work.

The key aim of this role is raising the profile of the private sector, brand oriented work for Ipsos MORI in the UK and growing our fame amongst current and potential clients. You’ll be responsible for increasing our external share of voice – increasing our visibility and growing our own “brand” - through your own personal contribution, and through identifying and bringing forward others in the organisation.

We are currently working from home, with our offices open and Covid secure if that suits you better. We anticipate a blended office and home working model post Covid.

What will I be doing?
Externally, you will be one of the key senior faces of Ipsos MORI in the private sector business. You will be personally writing and publishing thought pieces, talking at conferences and on panels, and will have an active highly engaged professional social media presence. You will be repackaging and repurposing the huge range of content already available in Ipsos to make it digestible, relevant and useful for brand owners in the private sector.

You’ll work closely and collaboratively across many internal Ipsos MORI teams; creating a strategy and an activation plan for our marketing & communications targeted at private sector brand owner audiences.

You’ll be a strong internal figurehead and mentor working across many teams, helping to develop and inspire the next generation of Ipsos MORI ‘fame makers’.


What do I need to bring with me?
You are likely to have been in a marketing-related role for a large part of your career to date and may have worked at a marketing agency, a consultancy, at an advertising or media agency, or client-side.
You will have a point of view on how to grow a brand’s public presence in the B2B space.
You will be able to demonstrate your ability to inspire, encourage and coach others in having a louder voice on behalf of Ipsos MORI.
We are looking for someone to spearhead our initiative to have a stronger presence in brand and marketing circles. In the UK we are known as being a trusted and respected global research agency, but our image is more widely associated with opinion polling and social/government research, and our work in the brand and private sector is less well known. The person in this role will be an inspirational leader who will galvanise our teams, and coordinate our efforts to be more famous.

You are:
Not necessarily from an insights background, however you will be research-literate. Being comfortable looking at data sources – quant, qual, social media and others – and finding the ‘so what’ that our clients will be interested in.
Alert and interested in the evolution and development of trends in the world, and how they relate to consumer marketing
Up to date on marketing theory and the current debates and theories.
Experienced in creating original content and are comfortable speaking out and have an engaging public presence.
Collaborative & curious about the possibilities for driving growth.
Comfortable & competent working in partnership with a senior audience of Marketing & Insights clients – you demonstrate gravitas, credibility and leadership.
Someone who gets a buzz from collaborating across multiple teams to harness the best of Ipsos. You’ll also bring with you a network of influential contacts in the marketing world outside the insights teams, and have ideas on how to develop your – and our – network further.
Someone people want to work with. You’re a leader, but are able to get hands-on as and when needed – able to think on your feet and flex & pivot as needed, bringing people along with you.
Comfortable working in a very fast-paced, high intensity environment. You move fast and keep up.

Today, we help clients with total transformation-inspiring complex change, enabling organizations to grow, building competitive advantage, and driving bottom-line impact.

To succeed, organizations must blend digital and human capabilities. Our diverse, global teams bring deep industry and functional expertise and a range of perspectives to spark change. BCG delivers solutions through leading-edge management consulting along with technology and design, corporate and digital ventures—and business purpose. We work in a uniquely collaborative model across the firm and throughout all levels of the client organization, generating results that allow our clients to thrive.

Digital BCG


BCG has a long history of driving growth by embracing innovation and new ways of thinking. Through DigitalBCG, we bring together a diverse mix of consultants and digital specialists to ensure that we are supporting our clients throughout their digital transformation journeys. We work with our clients to fully understand the impact of digital on their business and set priorities that will transform their vision into value. Whether it be developing new technologies to support their core business, making better use of their data, or pursuing entirely new sources of revenue, our aim is to achieve radical improvements in productivity, flexibility, and speed. We are innovating how our clients are using artificial intelligence, robotic process automation, internet of things, personalization, blockchain technologies, and more to gain competitive advantage.

DigitalBCG encompasses a broad set of data, digital, and technology capabilities from BCG consulting teams and practices, along with our business units such as BCG Digital Ventures, BCG Platinion, and BCG GAMMA.

What You'll Do

BCG’s Data & Digital offering is closely aligned to our Technology Advantage practice were we work with our clients (often CIOs and CTOs), to position companies for the future. The rapid advance of technology has resulted in an explosion of data in business. The ability to decode this data can unlock a higher level of insight and drive a superior level of performance. That’s where we come in.

With experts in Big Data, Digital Business models, IT strategy, and IT efficiency/effectiveness, we leverage digital solutions to power transformations that stick. We believe transformations fail when companies focus too much on the finish line and not enough on the capabilities that must be built in order to get there and—most importantly—to stay there. Our teams work with client members from all levels of the organization in order to integrate our staff's strategy, operational, and industry experience with the client's individual situation, culture, and unique constraints.

Data and Digital Platform Experts help our clients improve performance through the use of data and technology. The extent to which a company has made the transition to a digital organization determines its ability to effectively field data, extrapolate useful information, and act on it in real-time. By combining digital and data analytics expertise with battle-tested transformation experience, you will empower companies to make that leap.

In this role, you will drive the vision for target technology platforms that deliver on client business objectives, and outline an achievable roadmap to implementation. You will set the high-level structure for the transformation effort, manage to tight timelines and client deliverables, provide hands-on training, and deliver the key enablers required to complete the project. Your team will include senior BCG leadership, teams of BCG Consultants, and both junior and senior client leaders working collaboratively to facilitate the transformation.

The Expert Consulting Track (ECT) is vital to BCG’s ability to successfully meet our clients’ demand for deep expertise and advanced technical capabilities. Experts deliver next-level impact for BCG's most complex and cutting-edge client challenges. Experts focus on developing BCG's thought leadership, commercial capabilities, and intellectual property assets; and their work is essential to our delivery model. Working as part of a multidisciplinary team to bring the ‘best of BCG’ to our clients, Experts come from diverse backgrounds, with expertise often gained outside of BCG in industry, academia, or specialized consulting.

As an Expert Associate Director, you will apply your deep expertise to generate value for our clients while building and contributing to BCG’s intellectual capital. Your role in projects can vary from team management to team advisor. You will leverage your expertise to add insight and drive clients toward recommendations and you will be viewed as a trusted advisor by senior clients. You will help scope and structure the work, onboard team members, and provide guidance throughout the project. Expert Principals contribute significantly to BCG’s intellectual capital, generate interest and excitement about their expertise area, and coach and mentor others.

What You'll Bring (Experience & Qualifications)

We’re looking for exceptional talent from consulting or industry to join us. You would typically have:
A minimum of 8 years of experience in leading and managing large, complex enterprise-level technology transformations, with expertise around specific issues that arise with modernizing technology and data architectures (data lakes, in-memory databases, containers, microservices, and how these relate to legacy architectures, common ERP architecture. Overall, a demonstrated ability to translate analytics and digital strategy into data, technology, and operating model implications
Experience delivering large-scale transformation projects and successful implementation including staffing and leadership development while taking a hands-on approach with clients
An outstanding academic track record

Despite the pandemic the job market remains strong among small, high-growth pharmaceutical companies that are developing new treatments in specialty markets. We are working with one such organization as they expand their business in the Respiratory market. This dynamic company discovers and develops unique, small molecule therapies that feature multi-site binding properties and target only diseased tissues, reducing risk for side effects. They currently have one specialty product on the market and three more to launch over the next two years, and are now expanding their commercial strategy team. Although it’s still a very small commercial group, this is a dynamic, exciting work environment and their teams have unusually strong personal chemistry. If you’re looking for a strategic marketing challenge in an organization that is building a strong foundation for the future, this could be the opportunity for you.

The Role

The Director / Sr. Director of Commercial Strategy will lead the new product planning and pipeline strategy for a franchise of products used to treat asthma, COPD, IPF, and COVID-19. Duties include analytics, market research, forecasting and the development of value-based Target Product Profiles. You will provide commercial direction to clinical teams to identify which projects to initiate in their discovery process. You will assist in clinical trial design to optimize product value, and also work with medical affairs on publication planning and advocate development activities within the respiratory community. As products move toward launch you will also work with the marketing team on segmentation, product positioning and branding.

The small size of the commercial team means you will “wear many hats” in this high-profile assignment. The position currently has one direct report and will be adding another within six months. A key driver of success in the role will be the ability to lead cross-functional teams from across the organization to collaborate in a data-driven decision making manner. You will work with analytics staff on forecasts and valuation models as part of portfolio management within the respiratory market, and you’ll select and manage vendors for primary and secondary market research projects. This is a small, fast-paced environment so we need someone who is strong technically as well as strategically, and who is willing to “roll up their sleeves” and execute programs. This is a high visibility role with significant opportunity for career development and advancement.

Qualifications:
10+ years of strategic marketing and pipeline planning in the Biotech or Pharmaceutical industry
3+ years of pipeline strategy in the Respiratory or Pulmonary market
Bachelor’s degree or better is required; MBA or advanced degree in the Life Sciences is preferred
The ability and interest to advance to the VP level within three years
This dynamic organization is based in the San Francisco Bay area but this position can based anywhere in US with easy access to a major airport. They are committed to attracting the best people in the industry and will be one of the leaders in the post-COVID world of flexible work arrangements.

An attractive compensation package for this position includes a highly competitive base salary, an annual bonus based on company and individual performance, and an expanded equity package in the form of restricted stock units and stock options.

This is an opportunity to leverage your technical experience and relationships for something more than a simple paycheck. If this sounds like the type of environment you are seeking at this point in your career, and if your background meets these qualifications, please apply.

They are going through a period of positive change so it’s a fantastic opportunity to really shape the culture, continued growth and direction of the agency.
Before reading on for further information, please note some of the key attributes needed:
B2B technology experience – this doesn’t have to be your only area of expertise however as the agency does have its heartland in tech an understanding/interest of this sector is needed
New business acumen
A true integrated communications professional, with an understanding of how integrated teams work together
About the Agency
Integrated: Although many agencies claim to be integrated, this one truly is. Having rebranded several years ago as a marcomms agency, they continue to focus on real integration and cross working of teams to deliver the best results. With capabilities across Communications, Strategy, Creative, Design/UX, Social/Digital & Content, they have a client cetered approach, creating blended teams around specific briefs rather than being set in stone as seen in traditional PR agencies. The result? Real integration; and the right team to deliver inspiring and best in class work.
Full service: The agency is full service, with teams/specialisms across corporate communications, consumer and technology (b2b and consumer) with hugely recognisable blue chip names. However their heartland lies in technology, with clients such as Tinder, EE, Dell, Cisco and BAE Systems. As a result, we are looking for someone with b2b tech sector experience although this doesn’t have to be your only area of expertise or interest.
Global: The agency is part of a global network with over 130 people in the UK office.
Culture and Benefits: In the last few years, the agency has undergone a merger with its sister agency which has added to its client base and global reach. As it continues its rebrand as a marketing communications agency and with the merger, change is at the forefront. It’s a relatively flat structure with a warm, collaborative culture where people are encouraged to challenge the status quo. In terms of benefits – you’ll get UNLIMITED holiday plus gym, private healthcare and more.
The Role: Director – MD equivalent
As a whole the hierarchy is reasonably flat and there is a move away from job titles, however if we had to categorise it this role is a Director- MD level equivalent role. The agency is also moving away from media relations to more of a management consulting/strategic communications focus, so an additional title/specialism could be Head of Strategic Communications or Client Services.
Key attributes for success:
An understanding of integrated and how integrated teams can work together
B2B technology sector experience and interest
New business track record and an interest/vision for growth
The gravitas to get teams behind them, with the ability to lead when required
Experience of leading teams and agencies through change

Who We Are


Boston Consulting Group partners with leaders in business and society to tackle their most important challenges and capture their greatest opportunities. BCG was the pioneer in business strategy when it was founded in 1963. Today, we help clients with total transformation-inspiring complex change, enabling organizations to grow, building competitive advantage, and driving bottom-line impact.

To succeed, organizations must blend digital and human capabilities. Our diverse, global teams bring deep industry and functional expertise and a range of perspectives to spark change. BCG delivers solutions through leading-edge management consulting along with technology and design, corporate and digital ventures—and business purpose. We work in a uniquely collaborative model across the firm and throughout all levels of the client organization, generating results that allow our clients to thrive.

Digital BCG


BCG has a long history of driving growth by embracing innovation and new ways of thinking. Through DigitalBCG, we bring together a diverse mix of consultants and digital specialists to ensure that we are supporting our clients throughout their digital transformation journeys. We work with our clients to fully understand the impact of digital on their business and set priorities that will transform their vision into value. Whether it be developing new technologies to support their core business, making better use of their data, or pursuing entirely new sources of revenue, our aim is to achieve radical improvements in productivity, flexibility, and speed. We are innovating how our clients are using artificial intelligence, robotic process automation, internet of things, personalization, blockchain technologies, and more to gain competitive advantage.

DigitalBCG encompasses a broad set of data, digital, and technology capabilities from BCG consulting teams and practices, along with our business units such as BCG Digital Ventures, BCG Platinion, and BCG GAMMA.

What You'll Do

BCG’s Data & Digital offering is closely aligned to our Technology Advantage practice were we work with our clients (often CIOs and CTOs), to position companies for the future. The rapid advance of technology has resulted in an explosion of data in business. The ability to decode this data can unlock a higher level of insight and drive a superior level of performance. That’s where we come in.

With experts in Big Data, Digital Business models, IT strategy, and IT efficiency/effectiveness, we leverage digital solutions to power transformations that stick. We believe transformations fail when companies focus too much on the finish line and not enough on the capabilities that must be built in order to get there and—most importantly—to stay there. Our teams work with client members from all levels of the organization in order to integrate our staff's strategy, operational, and industry experience with the client's individual situation, culture, and unique constraints.

Data and Digital Platform Experts help our clients improve performance through the use of data and technology. The extent to which a company has made the transition to a digital organization determines its ability to effectively field data, extrapolate useful information, and act on it in real-time. By combining digital and data analytics expertise with battle-tested transformation experience, you will empower companies to make that leap.

In this role, you will drive the vision for target technology platforms that deliver on client business objectives, and outline an achievable roadmap to implementation. You will set the high-level structure for the transformation effort, manage to tight timelines and client deliverables, provide hands-on training, and deliver the key enablers required to complete the project. Your team will include senior BCG leadership, teams of BCG Consultants, and both junior and senior client leaders working collaboratively to facilitate the transformation.

The Expert Consulting Track (ECT) is vital to BCG’s ability to successfully meet our clients’ demand for deep expertise and advanced technical capabilities. Experts deliver next-level impact for BCG's most complex and cutting-edge client challenges. Experts focus on developing BCG's thought leadership, commercial capabilities, and intellectual property assets; and their work is essential to our delivery model. Working as part of a multidisciplinary team to bring the ‘best of BCG’ to our clients, Experts come from diverse backgrounds, with expertise often gained outside of BCG in industry, academia, or specialized consulting.

As an Expert Associate Director, you will apply your deep expertise to generate value for our clients while building and contributing to BCG’s intellectual capital. Your role in projects can vary from team management to team advisor. You will leverage your expertise to add insight and drive clients toward recommendations and you will be viewed as a trusted advisor by senior clients. You will help scope and structure the work, onboard team members, and provide guidance throughout the project. Expert Principals contribute significantly to BCG’s intellectual capital, generate interest and excitement about their expertise area, and coach and mentor others.

What You'll Bring (Experience & Qualifications)

We’re looking for exceptional talent from consulting or industry to join us. You would typically have:
A minimum of 8 years of experience in leading and managing large, complex enterprise-level technology transformations, with expertise around specific issues that arise with modernizing technology and data architectures (data lakes, in-memory databases, containers, microservices, and how these relate to legacy architectures, common ERP architecture. Overall, a demonstrated ability to translate analytics and digital strategy into data, technology, and operating model implications
Experience delivering large-scale transformation projects and successful implementation including staffing and leadership development while taking a hands-on approach with clients
An outstanding academic track record

Why Deliveroo?

When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London in 2004 and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. In 2013 Deliveroo was launched. Fast forward to 2020 and we operate in 12 markets with over 60,000 riders who deliver orders from 60,000 restaurants in over 500 cities worldwide.

We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it.

We work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allows us to deliver our orders in around 30 minutes.

And we're just getting started.

The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it's clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.

We are already a multi-billion pound company that has grown rapidly. Deliveroo came top in the FT's' list of Europe's fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte's 'UK Top 50' two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us.

We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We're a technology driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world, so come and join us for the ride.

Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.",3.5,"Deliveroo
