54,Web Administrator,San Francisco,Network Administrator,-1,"Provides 3rd Tier reactive remote and onsite support services to our partners. On the reactive side, the Tier 3 level Network Administrator typically troubleshoots more advanced issues in and around the PC, notebook, servers, network and advanced peripherals. Where this role differs greatly from the Service Desk Technician, the Network Administrator handles issues that the Service Desk Technician escalates due to the issue being outside of their competencies requiring someone with more specific knowledge of the inside workings of the network. The Network Administrator is also the one who performs onsite services when necessary. In addition to the reactive Tier 3 support, the Network Administrator also provides both remote and onsite proactive scheduled maintenance routines on a partner’s computer network, servers and other devices. This includes the implementation of common best-practices determined by the vCIO as well as many routine based checklist oriented routines. The best candidate for this position is someone with more advanced technical troubleshooting skills that include the ability to solve more complex problems around commonly found products such as Exchange, SQL, Web, File, Print, VMWare Servers, etc. This individual must have a deep understanding of all commonly used operating systems as well as a deep understanding of all applications such as Microsoft Office, Adobe Reader, Acrobat, Flash, etc. He or she must have their own means of transportation and be in a position to drive to a partner’s location within the greater Bay Area. He or she must be both presentable and able to clearly communicate as well as manage expectations between their team members and our partners’ computer users. The ability to successfully manage expectations in this position is one of the most important assets the Network Administrator can learn and possess. A Network Administrator with these abilities will always satisfy the needs and concerns of the computer user facing a technical challenge. Studies have shown that the satisfaction of a computer user is more dependent on them knowing that someone is working on the problem, where they are in the process and their action plan, rather than just coming in solving the issue at hand and then disappearing. Absolute requirements include: • A great attitude and pleasant personality • Willingness and interest to learn our process and how we do things • Has a calm and helpful presence while supporting customers via phone • Enjoys working with people; is patient, flexible, professional and presentable at all times • Driven, self-motivated, responsible, excellent multitasking abilities and organizational skills • Serves each client courteously and professionally as defined in a specific role within our system • Documents work in detail in our CRM based ticketing system There is tremendous opportunity for advancement and education within our company, depending on an individual’s motivation and advancement of skill level. Our positions are designed to allow a motivated individual to progress to higher roles as they gain experience and obtain more skills and education. All candidates for these positions will have the opportunity to enhance their skills through an internal training program as well as a lot of hands-on experience with many common tools used in the industry. Because much of what we do is of collaborative nature – meaning the embracing of the philosophy that “the team delivers the result to our partners, not the individual” – the roles also place a value on enhancing one’s communication skills with other team members and the end-users. Candidates that successfully embrace and master many of these skills are eligible to higher positions as these positions become available. To apply for these positions, please contact us for current employment opportunities or send an email with your resume, along with a cover letter describing what specifically interests you about a specific position, and indicate why you feel you are the best candidate, including what value you can bring to our team.

Our customers are experts in DNA design -- they send us their genetically engineered organisms for testing.
We grow their cells in our bioreactors to examine the efficacy of different protocols and their effect on yield and productivity.
Our customers monitor the state of things live via our website. At the end we send them some samples for storage or more custom analysis.

Our first product offering is a cloud bioreactor facility that allows biotechnology companies to design, run, and analyze high-throughput bioreactor experiments through our web application. We developed the product first for microbial fermentation and we're now extending it to mammalian cell culture.

Our cloud bioreactor lab empowers upstream bioprocess R&D teams to develop and scale biomanufacturing processes more quickly and easily.

Problem-solving: Websites need to be functional as well as attractive, and clients’ needs in these regards might not always be easy to meet. Web developers need to figure out how to translate a client’s vision to an actual, functional website.
Good under pressure: Tight deadlines are common when designing or updating websites. Developers need to be able to handle the pressure of having work done when needed.

99,Web Administrator,San Francisco,Software Developer/Data Engineer/Platform Administrator,-1,"Your Opportunity


In Corporate Risk Management we provide an integrated risk management strategy that supports the delivery of predictable financial and operational performance in order to produce successful client and shareholder outcomes. We are organized around six primary functions: Enterprise Risk; Credit, Market, and Investment Risk; Information Security Risk; Model Risk; Operational Risk; and Financial Crimes Risk.

What you are good at


You will work in Financial Crimes Risk Management (FCRM), one of the six primary Risk Management functions at Schwab. Among other things, this team manages the risk of loss in Money Movement services offered through Schwab Bank and Brokerage affiliates.

More specifically, you will join the (FDP) Fraud Data Platforms Department, within Financial Crimes Risk Management. FDP is primarily responsible for:
Fraud Prevention Data
Fraud Prevention Platforms/Technology
As a Fraud Data Engineer for the FDP department, you will primarily perform four duties:
Data Engineering; Collaborating, sourcing, ingesting, redefining, storing, curating, querying and preparing data
Application Development; Write original code to develop SQL Server Objects and .NET GUI enhancements
Data Platform Administration; Includes but is not limited to application audits, tests, controls, compliance and regulatory administration
Data Platform Migration; Potentially migrating homegrown data applications to Enterprise support.
It is very important to note that although this is a technical position, it is on the Business side of Schwab and not on the Technology side of the company. This means you act as your own Business Analyst, and you are confident interacting with many different partners both in-person, and through technology. In other words, you are first and foremost a Cyber, Risk and Fraud Professional who protects our clients from crime. Secondarily you are a skilled Technologist who also understands the importance of tech administration.

It is also important to note that early on you will primarily work in a Microsoft Stack environment; specifically in SQL Server, Visual Studio and as a .NET UI Developer. As our department and therefore our technology progresses, you may be spending more time in Big Data environments such as Hadoop, or Cloud environments such as GCP or AWS. This transition will take time, but it is important to have an interest in updating your skills as required.

Data Engineering:You are an experienced Data Engineer and .NET UI Developer working as an individual contributor and self-reliant decision maker. However, although your business title is “Data Engineer,” you are a Tech Generalist with a broad background in several areas including: Software Engineer/Developer, Systems Engineer, Release Engineer, and Data/Systems Architect. Additionally, and as needed, you will play an active role as your own Production Support for fraud prevention applications, primarily in the

Microsoft Stack.

Responsibilities include assessing business partner data needs, then sourcing, ingesting, redefining, blending, automating, storing, querying and preparing those data to meet analytical or reporting needs. Among other things this may involve contacting vendors as well as internal Schwab departments and product owners, researching data dictionaries and navigating legacy as well as modern data systems. Examples of data assets you may work with include web, client, account, transaction and more. Partners relying on your data create fraud prevention strategies through a range of simple-to-advanced analytics. Among other Risk Management topics, Client Experience and Crime Prevention are central themes, particularly as they relate to money movement channels such as Wire, ACH, Card, Check, Bill Pay, Account Open, etc.

Application Development:One of our primary applications is currently written in .NET. From time to time you will be asked to write enhancements. Over time this application may get migrated but initially, GUI improvements will be one of your four primary responsibilities.

Data Platform Administration:Platform administration is foundational to compliance, and being on the business side of technology you will often be your own administrator. This includes but is not limited to application audits, tests, controls, compliance and regulatory paperwork. Financial Services is a regulated industry meaning timely administration is important to our clients and our company.

Data Platform Migration:As Charles Schwab matures, you may play a role in migrating older, “homegrown” data-tech platforms, supported by you, to enterprise-level platforms developed by you, but supported by Enterprise Technology Services. This transition will take time which means as a Technologist, perseverance is your strength. Like many financial services companies, Schwab is migrating to Big Data and Cloud, but given our responsibility to safely manage our clients’ assets, this change will take time.

Overall Crucial Duties Include:
Improve the Client/Brand experience while helping to minimize financial crimes.
Share responsibility for protecting clients and company from criminal activity such as ID theft, Scams, Synthetic ID, Account Take-Over and New Account Fraud.
Develop technical connections to new data sources such as relational databases, NoSQL databases, Hadoop, NAS drives, weblogs, Hive tables and distributed file systems and applications.
Ingest new data into SQL Server databases.
Build data objects, job flows, code and applications.
Work with vendors and internal and external business partners to acquire new data feeds to advise risk management and fraud prevention activities.
Share technical ownership of the Risk Data infrastructure including databases, data objects, GUIs and job flows.
Modernize, automate, maintain and scale data-related processes and infrastructure.
Move large amounts of data, write original data management and GUI development code, create custom views and data sets.
Store and manage sensitive data in SQL Server and Hadoop.
Regularly deliver ad-hoc data solutions such as simple-to-complex queries and analytic data sets.
Act as your own application administrator and production support.
Develop in a .NET UI environment.
Take an interactive and visible role within your department as well as with business partners.

Important Information

FINRA’s Code of Conduct imposes restrictions on employees’ investments and requires financial disclosures that are uniquely related to our role as a securities regulator. FINRA employees are required to disclose to FINRA all brokerage accounts that they maintain, and those in which they control trading or have a financial interest (including any trust account of which they are a trustee or beneficiary and all accounts of a spouse, domestic partner or minor child who lives with the employee) and to authorize their broker-dealers to provide FINRA with duplicate statements for all of those accounts. All of those accounts are subject to the Code’s investment and securities account restrictions, and new employees must comply with those investment restrictions—including disposing of any security issued by a company on FINRA’s Prohibited Company List or obtaining a written waiver from their Executive Vice President—by the date they begin employment with FINRA. Employees may only maintain securities accounts that must be disclosed to FINRA at one or more securities firms that provide an electronic feed (e-feed) of data to FINRA, and must move securities accounts from other securities firms to a firm that provides an e-feed within three months of beginning employment.

UCSF’s Department of Surgery (DOS) is one of the largest School of Medicine (SOM) departments providing caring surgical care, researching the next breakthroughs in medicine, and training medical students, residents, and fellows. The mission of the Department is threefold: to develop the next generation of leaders in surgery; to provide outstanding quality clinical care that is cost effective, yet compassionate; and to make significant advances in scientific knowledge and clinical practice through basic and clinical research. The care of patients is what attracted our faculty and residents to surgery, and it continues to be our main focus. The Department is comprised of eleven divisions across multiple sites (Parnassus, Mount Zion, Mission Bay, Zuckerberg San Francisco General (ZSFG) Hospital, San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center (SFVAMC) and East Bay).

The Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery is one of the divisions in the DOS with a mission to serve and care for patients with vascular diseases.

Our surgeons and staff provide compassionate, state-of-the-art care for patients across the full range of vascular disorders in multiple locations around San Francisco and the Bay Area. Our program is closely integrated with several specialized centers. As one of the leading academic divisions in Vascular and Endovascular Surgery across the country, we have two fellowship programs for trainees. Our faculty are conducting cutting-edge basic, translational, and clinical research, which has led to novel technologies to benefit patients across the world.
