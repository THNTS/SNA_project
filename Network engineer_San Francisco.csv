59,Network engineer,San Francisco,System Administrator,-1,"Do you have what it takes to be challenged every day? Essai, Inc. is in search of inquisitive, creative, determined candidates who enjoy problem-solving and taking a theoretical concept into real-world applications to fill our *(System Administrator) *position.

Essai, Inc. is a dynamic and innovative high-tech manufacturing company located in *(**Fremont, CA**)*. We are looking for exceptional individuals to join our team, who have high desire and drive to succeed both personally and professionally, in a fast paced and growing company. Located in the heart of Silicon Valley, Essai is a diverse, environmental-friendly company whose commitment to excellence has been recognized by America’s Fastest–Growing Private 5000 Companies.
JOB RESPONSIBILITY*
This is an excellent opportunity for an experienced Microsoft Windows Server systems administrator at our automated manufacturing and assembly plant located in the east side of the Silicon Valley in Fremont, CA. This position will be responsible for the day-to-day technical support, administration, maintenance, and documentation of an existing production network of servers, manufacturing control and engineering workstations, and desktop and laptop PCs, under the supervision of managing IT personnel.

In addition to day-to-day technical support, your primary responsibility will be maintaining the IT infrastructure and supporting environment that keeps our automated manufacturing machines’ spindles spinning. Therefore, this is a 24x7x365 on-call position, which includes monitoring critical system alerts. Occasional early, late, and/or long hours are required.

To be successful, you must be able to work independently, Monday–Friday from 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM, cultivate professional relationships with key stakeholders throughout the facility, and maintain a positive and enthusiastic approach. Importantly, you must stop, listen to and triage internal IT customer’s issues on demand, isolate or escalate their technical problems, and execute appropriate solutions for them.
MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS*
TECHNICAL COMPETENCE: Four years of solid Microsoft Windows Server operating experience in a corporate networked environment that demonstrates a broad skillset. This skillset should include: comprehensive knowledge of Microsoft Active Directory, DNS and DHCP, internal trust relationships, file systems, rights and permissions, access tokens and ACLs, and the Computer Browser Service — the basics of Windows file services.

Strong working knowledge of Windows administrative tools and command-line utilities. Clear understanding of IPv4 addressing, IP subnetting, IP routing, and TCP/IP core protocols and services in addition to DNS and DHCP: including ARP, ICMP, SMTP, RPC, HTTP, SSL and SMB/CIFS — to name a few — along with their associated utilities. The methods and sequence of name resolution for commands and tools that use the WinSock and NetBIOS interfaces.

Familiarity with the physical media and working characteristics of IEEE 802.3 Ethernet specifications, TIA Category 5/5e/6/6A cabling standards, and TIA-568B pinouts; the address space of the private internets as defined in RFCs 1918 and 3927; along with IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi concepts and SNIA standard RAID levels. Exchange Server and VMware administration experience is a plus.

COMMUNICATION SKILLS: To achieve our communications skills requirements you should be formally and rigorously trained and have a Microsoft MCSE certification — or a current Microsoft equivalent — in one of the various Microsoft Windows Server generations starting with Windows 2000 Server or above. Your certification(s) should include passed exams in TCP/IP core protocols and services.

We want you to be able to accurately convey technical concepts in English both to colleagues and, with a suitable adjustment, to non-technical internal IT customers. As an essential adjunct to work experience, education and other achievements, we’ve found that people with formal vendor skills-based training who have diligently put in the effort to pass exams and earn an appropriate vendor certification have developed a naturally accompanying aptitude and vocabulary to communicate these technical concepts and complex ideas quickly, clearly and concisely.

A necessary consequence of supporting our fast-paced production environment with these types of skills is that you must also be able to speak and write in English, easily, fluently, and coherently.

Reciting the NATO phonetic alphabet in under 10 seconds, cold, is a definite plus.

RIGHT ATTITUDE: In addition to technical competence and communication skills, we place a high premium on right attitude. Behavior is important. We are looking for an individual who is willing to be a first point of contact for the IT department in Fremont, who has a track record of offering a customer-oriented mindset, and who has an established history of collaborating with colleagues.

On a day-to-day basis, this requires (a) being present Monday–Friday from 8:00 – 5:00 PM, (b) reaching out to, cultivating, and maintaining excellent, open channels of communication with internal IT customers, and (c) providing quick and positive responses to your teammates in the IT department by being readily forthcoming and fulsome with your technical knowledge, skills, and configurations — passing them on freely, without obligation.

An easy, genuine, gracious willingness to drop what you’re doing and serve other people on demand — both customers and teammates, alike — is an expectation! Likewise, the ability to expand your consciousness beyond yourself in an attempt to see and take into account other people’s viewpoints with a little dry wit, a friendly smile, and a great sense of humor is most welcome!
SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, AND ABILITIES REQUIRED*
A Bachelor of Science degree in science, technology, engineering, or math is certainly preferred, but not required. We will also gladly welcome degrees in music, languages, linguistics, or related disciplines that share the cognitive domains of metrical structure, recursion, and the use of memory. Again, not required, but unquestionably a plus.

On the other hand, as many people have proven, college degrees are not always the be-all/end-all requirement for fruitful economic participation or a great career. However, if for no other reason, the process of attaining any four-year degree demonstrates a worthwhile common denominator: it shows the extent to which we are willing to exert our will power, exercise self-control, set aside other desires, and sustain these disciplines over long durations to achieve something of significance.

Knowing what we want, setting long-term goals, resolving to accomplish them, procuring funding, associating with people who can help us get what we want, reliably fulfilling obligations, planning our work, adhering to a schedule, balancing our lives, devoting our energies efficiently and effectively, working and playing well with others, accepting correction — all while using our volition over four years to responsibly execute a wide variety of difficult tasks, stick with them, and see them all through to completion — a college degree tells an employer quite a lot.

So, if you do not have a four-year college degree but you meet the minimum qualifications, listed above — technical competence, communication skills, and right attitude — and you can truly establish in writing, by outlining a history of previous achievements, your abilities to plan, manage and execute tasks, and see assignments and projects through to completion with little to no supervision, then we’ll happily consider that in lieu of a four-year degree. If this is the case, please be equipped with a list of your lifetime achievements, briefly stated on a single sheet of paper.

You should also be able to sit and work at a computer keyboard with a mouse for extended periods of time; stoop, kneel, bend and reach from the waist on a daily basis; leverage a hand truck, operate and push/pull a pallet jack, and climb a ladder or ride a scissor lift to service enclosure-, rack-, floor-, wall-, or ceiling-mounted equipment. Occasionally, you’ll need to be able to move and lift up to 60 pounds above your waste or 50 pounds overhead — equivalents of a box of 10 reams of paper, 24 and 20 lb., respectively.

Please come prepared with three professional references, listing your supervisors from previous employers that can substantiate your background, including their current contact information.
Please Note: * This position is for our *(**Fremont, CA**)* location. There is no relocation assistance or visa sponsorship offered at this time. Job offers are pending successful completion of a background check, drug screen, and reference check.
Due to the large volume of resumes received, we are unable to acknowledge receipt of all applications. Candidates who meet specific qualifications will be contacted during the course of this search.

Across three core Initiative focus areas of Science, Education and Justice and Opportunity, we're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and movement building, to help build an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.

Our Values


We believe we can help build a future for everyone.
We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.
We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.
Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.
Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

The Opportunity


By pairing engineers with leaders in our education, science, and justice and opportunity teams, we can bring technology to the table in new ways to help drive solutions. We are uniquely positioned to craft, build, and scale software systems to help educators, scientists, and policy specialists better address the myriad challenges they face. Our technology team is already helping schools bring personalized learning tools to teachers and schools across the country and supporting scientists around the world as they develop a comprehensive reference atlas of all cells in the human body.

The product security team works to secure products being developed across all of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. Members of the product security team have an impact on all of CZI's initiatives by championing security principles during the software development lifecycle and by building scalable, cleverly engineered 'paved roads' which give strong security assurances by default. In this role, you will critically examine the existing applications, identify the areas of greatest impact, lay out the roadmap for the team, and begin to build the highest impact solutions.

187,Network engineer,San Francisco,Principal Engineer - Office of the CTO,-1,"Fastly helps people stay better connected with the things they love. Fastly's edge cloud platform enables customers to create great digital experiences quickly, securely, and reliably by processing, serving, and securing our customers' applications as close to their end-users as possible — at the edge of the Internet. The platform is designed to take advantage of the modern internet, to be programmable, and to support agile software development. Fastly's customers include many of the world's most prominent companies, including Vimeo, Pinterest, The New York Times, and GitHub.

We're building a more trustworthy Internet. Come join us.

Principal Engineer - Office of the CTO

Engineers in the Office of the CTO tend to arrive at Fastly with a specialty and a wide breadth of knowledge in support of it, and a desire to find ways of applying their knowledge in that area that will fundamentally change Fastly, our community, or the entire internet. This can end up taking all sorts of forms: Protocol development and standardization, distributed systems and database research and prototyping, network monitoring and optimization, and plenty of others. Frequently, the specific area is less important than your creativity and tenacity in finding novel and sometimes ground-breaking applications.

Want to learn from, teach, and collaborate with some of the folks behind things like Lucet, WASI, HTTP/3, and QUIC? Consider applying to work with us!

What You'll Do
Come up with new ideas for ways we can serve our customers and their users
Validate those ideas via experiments, measurement, and critical feedback
Develop prototypes of those ideas, as well as the ideas of your peers
Advocate for those ideas to your peers and the company as a whole
Talk about your successes and failures publicly in the form of blog posts, talks, and sometimes academic articles
Collaborate with other teams at Fastly on finding problems and solutions
Collaborate with external groups in standards communities, academic institutions, and other companies
What We're Looking For

We value a variety of voices, so an ideal candidate will have SOME of the following experience. We don't expect you to have all of these.
Much of this role is about communication both internally and externally, so you should have experience at writing and speaking.
Fastly's traffic scale is truly enormous, so having experience with large-scale systems is important.
Ideas and prototypes will be much of what you do, but that is all for nothing if it can't make it to production. So, you should have experience taking real projects to production.
We don't require a formal CS education, but your experience and knowledge should be at a Masters or PhD level.
Taking academic ideas and turning them into working systems is a skill in itself; you should have some experience at this.
At the most fundamental level, Fastly relies upon and is relied upon by the internet. You should have a solid understanding of how the internet works at a fundamental technological level and at a larger political level.
While we're looking for someone with a specialty, this role is still practical and having a wide breadth of knowledge and experience will help you to apply your specialty.
Fastly primarily writes its systems in Rust, C, and Go. You should have a very good grasp of one or more of those.
We learn from each other. You should be willing and able to mentor and educate your coworkers, as well as be educated and mentored by them.
Why Fastly?
We have a huge impact. Fastly is a small company with a big reach. Not only do our customers have a tremendous user base, but we also support a growing number of open source projects and initiatives. Outside of code, employees are encouraged to share causes close to their heart with others so we can help lend a supportive hand.
We love distributed teams. Fastly's home-base is in San Francisco, but we have multiple offices and employees sprinkled around the globe. In fact, 50% of our employees work outside of SF! An international remote culture is in our DNA.
We care about you. Fastly works hard to create a positive environment for our employees, and we think your life outside of work is important too. We support our teams with great benefits like up to 20 weeks of paid parental leave, options for free medical/dental/vision plans, and an open vacation program that enables our folks to take the time they need to recharge (some benefits may vary by location).
We value diversity. Growing and maintaining our inclusive and diverse team matters to us. We are committed to being a company where our employees feel comfortable bringing their authentic selves to work and have the ability to be successful -- every day.
We are passionate. Fastly is chock full of passionate people and we're not 'one size fits all'. Fastly employs authors, pilots, skiers, parents (of humans and animals), makeup geeks, coffee connoisseurs, and more. We love employees for who they are and what they are passionate about.
We're always looking for humble, sharp, and creative folks to join the Fastly team. If you think you might be a fit please apply!
