ORGANIZATIONAL OVERVIEW
IAVI is a nonprofit scientific research organization dedicated to addressing urgent, unmet global health challenges including HIV and tuberculosis. Our mission is to translate scientific discoveries into affordable, globally accessible public health solutions.
Through scientific and clinical research in Africa, India, Europe, and the U.S., IAVI is pioneering the development of biomedical innovations designed for broad global access. We develop vaccines and antibodies in and for the developing world and seek to accelerate their introduction in low-income countries.
IAVI programs and partnerships are grounded in the regions of the world where the disease burden is the greatest, and our approach emphasizes sustainability. Our network of clinical research center partners in Africa and India helps strengthen in-country research capacity and supports the training and education of the next generation of scientists. The global impact of our science includes fundamental contributions to understanding the biology of HIV infection, which IAVI and others are applying toward advancing vaccine science and immunology.
IAVI accelerates scientific discovery and development by fostering unique collaborations among academia, industry, local communities, governments, and funders to explore new and better ways to address public health threats that disproportionately affect people living in poverty.
Our global reach, including a clinical research network in five countries in sub-Saharan Africa and in India, has allowed us to make fundamental contributions to understanding the epidemiology, transmission, virology, and immunology of HIV. This work played a key role in facilitating the design of promising HIV vaccine candidates, as well as the discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies that are now being advanced as promising approaches for HIV prevention. Our integrated capabilities in vaccine and antibody discovery, development, and clinical research take advantage of bio-pharmaceutical industry expertise to accelerate the development and testing of prevention methods for HIV and other diseases. Through the Product Development Center, we support external researchers with technical and scientific expertise to accelerate the development of their own products.
IAVI CORE VALUES
• Dedication to the Mission: We are committed to the translation of scientific discoveries into affordable, globally accessible public health solutions.
• Innovative Evolution: We are committed to solving complex problems in creative and innovative ways, learning from our mistakes and successes and never giving up

However right now, like most companies around the world, we’re embracing remote working. Our studio has slowly started to re-open for those who'd like to spend time there (all optional of course) but our later plan is to develop a hybrid model, where some purposeful in-person working will sit alongside continued remote working. This means that to work at Idean UK your fixed place of residence must be in or around London (although we appreciate you might be elsewhere right now).

More about the role

As a Technology Director you will define the path that Idean takes in delivering software for our clients, now and in the future. You will lead our technology teams and collaborate with the other Idean disciplines to ensure we deliver ground-breaking digital experiences to our clients. The Technology Director will play a key part in the growth of the technology offering at Idean and therefore be comfortable owning relationships with our clients.

This is a multi-faceted lead role. You will be responsible for the technology that powers these products; if it’s technical, you own it. It breaks down like this:

Technical leadership - being clear on where the technology needs to go, how it will get there, and what the benefits will be.
New feature design - work with our product managers and designers to design, scope and prioritise new features.
Stakeholder management - own relationships with our C-Level clients, becoming a trusted advisor to technical and non-technical groups alike.
Delivering value to our clients as quickly as possible. In technology terms, this means we get stuff built and shipped and into customers hands as fast.
Development and deployment methodology - how do features get planned, built and deployed? Ensuring we start projects efficiently, but with an eye on the long-term lifecycle of an enterprise-grade product.
Championing Agile best practices, DevOps culture and Continuous Delivery.
Lead, coach and support engineers - work with them to do their best work helping them along the way.
Technical quality - owning the technical backlog and technical quality of the product.

We work with a lot of different technologies. We don’t have a set stack, although we lean towards contemporary open source frameworks and cloud services that let us get stuff done quickly. You’ll play a key role in helping ensure we’ve got an eye on what trends are coming next too.

You will

You have

Demonstrable experience delivering technical projects from conception to delivery to growth.
A comprehensive technical background and experience of a wide range of modern technologies, architecture and concepts. Your specific knowledge of a particular language isn’t as important as your grasp on the pros/cons and tradeoffs each one brings.

A contemporary attitude and approach to building innovative products and services.
The ability to represent the technology perspective to our clients at management or board level.
The ability to set the technical direction and goals on a project, create a productive working environment, and support our developers to grow.

Comfort reflecting on your individual performance and behaviours and, together with feedback from others, you will actively seek to continuously improve.
Buckets of positivity and a “can do” attitude.

Organisational overview

Nest is a great government delivery success story. Established in 2010, Nest has been a critical pillar of the government’s automatic enrolment programme, with a public service obligation (PSO) to accept any employer wishing to use the scheme to discharge their automatic enrolment duties.

About LHH

The world of work is changing fast.

Profound changes at profound speed.

But whereas many see change as an existential threat,

a select few see it as an opportunity to make a difference.

An opportunity to deliver lifelong employability to a generation of talent in transition.

An opportunity to develop leaders, recognizing the capabilities needed for today,

while nurturing the expertise needed for the future.

And an opportunity to look beyond what’s right for a company, to what’s right for society as a whole.

And out of the few that see these opportunities, there are even fewer placed to actually deliver them.

At Lee Hecht Harrison, we have the scale, the expertise and the insight, not only to identify these opportunities, but to realize them.

Transforming workforces though career transition, talent development and strategic advisory.

Developing future skills, flexibility and foresight, delivered with a distinctly human heart.

We’re obsessively passionate, and quantifiably effective.

Making a difference to everyone we work with and for. And delivering it on a global scale.

Because opportunities aren’t there to be observed.

They’re there to be taken.

This is LHH.

This is Opportunity, delivered.

Are you a talented digital marketing manager who loves to explore new ways of optimising and scaling marketing channels?
Are you results-driven and motivated by your earnings, progression & the value you bring to the company?
Do you have a natural talent for marketing and understand what is needed to attract and convert new customers?
Would you love to be able to work remotely from anywhere in the world and help a team who are on a mission to make a real impact in the world?
If so, you will be very excited to learn about an opportunity to join our remote-working team at The Coaching Masters. *
What We Do *
The Coaching Masters is an online education platform that sells coaching-related information- products. Our product line includes: a membership platform, coaching certifications, NLP training, business launch programs, merchandise, global events and we are currently in the process of opening co-working spaces in south-east Asia.
Why We Do It *
We are very passionate about making a change in the world and we do that by educating people on the power of coaching and what it can do for their life as well as the lives of others. We are not just advocating for the process of coaching, but the lifestyle it can bring by being able to start your own online life-coaching business and working from anywhere in the world. We have a strong global community and have an entirely remote-working team
Where We Are Right Now *
We have built a strong community of 900 paying members, hundreds of people have taken our courses, have a team of 15, and are achieving revenues in the seven-figure mark. We’ve achieved this success in the last 18 months and has taken us a while to build the internal operations that will ensure we can scale. We now have the right team, infrastructure, marketing funnels, and scalable product-line, which means we are now looking for a talented, pro-active, Digital Marketing Manager to help scale our marketing efforts. We see paid traffic being the main focus on this role, by driving new people into our existing eco-system. There will be tweaks needed to our funnel from time to time, but as our marketing is already converting and bringing in a substantial ROI, the first area of growth will be to multiply our reach using various new traffic sources.
Our Growth-Focused Mindset *
We are very much focused on growth, so the person who is the right fit for this role will look to come into the role to transform the department. We think big, so we’d want someone to aim to double leads in the business over 3-6 months. This shouldn’t be hard based on our growth anyway, but the person for this role would be there to ensure it happens as quickly as possible. These results and growth will be compensated back in bonuses. We want to ensure you’re motivated to grow the division and are financially rewarded for doing so.
Your Experience *
The right candidate would have experience and education with online-based marketing with proven results in managing and optimising campaigns with a successful return on investment. Experience in any of the following areas is desirable, but not all of them are essential, as we are happy to either hire freelancers to maintain some channels of pay for training and courses that may allow you to acquire new skills to bring to the marketing department. However, you’d need to bring considerable experience and results to some of the following areas to be able to comfortably take control of the department and help us scale. _(Experience running paid traffic would be essential to this role.) _
Data Analysis
Influencer Marketing
Paid Traffic: Facebook, Instagram, Google, YouTube & LinkedIn
Content Marketing
Email Marketing
Affiliate Marketing
SEO
There will be a few key areas of this role:

• *Manage the existing marketing team. *Ensure they’re performing, following tasks as requested, and are giving direction to be able to grow and improve each section of the marketing department. Management duties would include the following:

o Suggest ideas weekly for growth and optimisation
o Monitor Performance for each team member & department
o Monitors KPI’s & targets of each sub-section of marketing and individual
o Escalate information about team, problems, ideas, and KPI numbers to Senior-

Management
*Carrying out Marketing Responsibilities. *Although there is a small team to support the marketing manager, including staff, directors, and freelancers, some tasks will be required to be carried out directly by the marketing manager. These tasks can be shuffled about based on results and skillset, and we also can hire new staff if it can be proven that they can generate additional income for the business. However, for now, the following tasks would be down to the Marketing Manager to carry out:
*Marketing Data & Analytics: *This will involve using software to track and analyze data to ensure targets are being met by the team, identify the key areas to increase or decrease marketing budget, as well as gathering insights into customers behavior that will allow us to improve conversions or increase leads.
*Influencer Management: *This will involve generating an influencer portfolio for promotions to promote our company webinars, or receive a gift in exchange for promotion. We will also be looking to use influencers to grow our social media following.
*Paid Traffic Management: *Running are paid ads from Facebook, YouTube, Google, LinkedIn and YouTube. Some are already set up and some will need to be started from scratch. We are currently only using half of the channels we could be using, which means the opportunity for fast growth is huge, and so is the financial bonus from increased revenue in the business too.
*Email Marketing: *Sending out daily emails to drive leads into our existing funnels and other marketing channels with the focus on converting new customers through daily valuable content and promotional offers.
Requirements *
Have at least 4 years’ experience working directly in digital marketing.
Have some form of education whether that is from university or private education.
Have previous results scaling marketing budgets with profitable ROAS.
Have a motivated & passionate outlook on digital marketing.
Have a growth mindset to learn new skills and find solutions.
Have the ability to stay motivated and work in a remote-working team with little management.
We Are Looking for A Partner Not an Employee *
The person who secures this role would need to be hard-working, and extremely fast-paced. If we have ideas, we have a work-ethic within our team that wants to see it implemented immediately. We are all about taking imperfect action and growing quickly. So, the person suited to this role would need to be self-motivated and prepared to try new things and get stuck in. To fit in with our team, you’d be focused on your results, earnings, and the impact we make in the business, rather than your basic-salary and the number of hours you put in. We are flexible with hours, but we expect the role to be embodied so it’s a part of your everyday life. If messages are being sent about in the evenings and weekends, this is not unusual – but at the same time, sitting in the spa whilst you create some new ideas, or meeting with a new influencer for cocktails in the middle of the day, is completely fine too. We see our way of working as a lifestyle, one you should enjoy, and look forward to getting started each morning!
Pro-Active Builder & Creator *
The right fit to join our team would also be okay with creating new processes and systems for themselves. We are a start-up; therefore, some systems and processes have not been set up yet, and there isn’t always guidance or support on how to do something. This role would require a willingness to research and learn new skills and show initiative on how to tackle certain objectives without always having a set list of tasks and instructions on how to complete them. We would want you to see this exciting new project for you to make your own.
Next Steps *
If you’re confident you’d be able to bring value and results to the Marketing Department and you are eager to join our team and help us push our products far and wide, throughout the world, then please send your CV and cover letter in response to the above job description outlining why you think you’d be perfect for the role. We are looking to see that someone can take the time to *read the above outline and respond accurately *to the objectives we have, showing us that you value this position and have taken the time to understand what we need from you.

Please send the CV and covering letter to the attention of the CEO, Lewis Raymond Taylor to info @ thecoachingmasters . com. Bonus points will be given for any other initiative you could offer that we allow you to stand out from other applicants. We’ll get back to you to discuss an interview if we feel you could be the right fit to join our team. We are looking to hire the right candidate immediately.

About LHH

The world of work is changing fast.

Profound changes at profound speed.

But whereas many see change as an existential threat,

a select few see it as an opportunity to make a difference.

An opportunity to deliver lifelong employability to a generation of talent in transition.

An opportunity to develop leaders, recognizing the capabilities needed for today,

while nurturing the expertise needed for the future.

And an opportunity to look beyond whats right for a company, to whats right for society as a whole.

And out of the few that see these opportunities, there are even fewer placed to actually deliver them.

At Lee Hecht Harrison, we have the scale, the expertise and the insight, not only to identify these opportunities, but to realize them.

Transforming workforces though career transition, talent development and strategic advisory.

Developing future skills, flexibility and foresight, delivered with a distinctly human heart.

Were obsessively passionate, and quantifiably effective.

Making a difference to everyone we work with and for. And delivering it on a global scale.

Because opportunities arent there to be observed.

Theyre there to be taken.

This is LHH.

This is Opportunity, delivered.

Background to the Role

What is Official Development Assistance (ODA)?

ODA-funded activity focuses on outcomes that promote the long-term sustainable growth of countries on the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) list. The main ODA focus for UKRI, managed through the International Development Team, is the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) and the Newton Fund.

The Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) is a £1.5 billion fund announced by the UK Government to support cutting-edge research that addresses the challenges faced by developing countries through:

Challenge-led disciplinary and interdisciplinary research
Strengthening capacity for research and innovation within both the UK and developing countries
Providing an agile response to emergencies where there is an urgent research need.

The Newton Fund is a £735 million UK investment Fund, with partner countries providing matched resources within the Fund. The Fund was launched in 2014 and extended and expanded in 2016.

The Newton Fund aims to promote the economic development and social welfare of either the partner countries or, through working with the partner country, to address the wellbeing of communities. It will do so through strengthening partner country science and innovation capacity and unlocking further funding to support this work.

UKRI is the largest GCRF and Newton Fund Delivery Partner, but significant activity is also delivered through the Learned Societies, UK Space Agency, the British Council and the Met Office.

The International Development Team works closely with other UKRI areas such as UKRI International. The team reports to the UKRI International Senior Responsible Officer, Professor Andrew Thompson.

Business unit information

The award winning Commercial Capability Team was formed in 2014/15 to bolster departments in improving their commercial capability. A new concept for government, we have developed a suite of capability services that central government departments and wider government bodies can access. A Commercial Recruitment Hub has been created, offering a centralised recruitment service for departments to fill commercial vacancies starting from Commercial Managers progressing up to Senior Commercial Specialists. Within this hub there is a pool of centrally-employed and accredited commercial professionals that can be assigned to departments to work on commercial assignments. Once in the role, these individuals have access to training and accreditation programmes, they are assigned their own commercial career coach and benefit from a tailored talent management service. We want to be the best commercial function in the United Kingdom. Thus the Commercial Capability Program has been created to attract, retain, develop and reward these specialists, to ensure we appeal to the best in the commercial sector to come and join us. Along with providing departments with this talent pool, as a Commercial Capability Program, we also support central and wider government in commercial capability training, advice and guidance.

This role will sit within the Commercial Blueprints Team, a team critical to the success of the overall Government Commercial Function (which the Commercial Capability team sits within). It supports Commercial Directors across Whitehall to explore, test, strengthen and articulate their functional strategy and delivery plans in areas such as operational models, organisational models, functional governance and influence, stakeholder relations, systems and technology usage and so on.

The scale and complexity of this function means that we must have data at the heart our work; using insights to underpin commercial strategies, enable effective decision-making and improve the overall understanding of the function.

About the job
Summary
Do you want to help the UK reach its climate change goals? Do you have a passion for using evidence to underpin policy making? We want enthusiastic professional analysts to join our Energy and Security Analysis team, working on issues that have a real impact on everyone’s everyday lives.

In 2019, the Government set an ambitious target for the UK to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. To help us reach that target we need to make decisions now about the way we generate and use energy in the future, as well as ensuring that our energy system is both affordable and secure. Those decisions need to be underpinned and informed by high quality analysis. In the Energy Security and Analysis team, we play a fundamental role throughout the policy cycle, from development through to implementation and evaluation. The team of around 50 multidisciplinary analysts work together using a range of techniques including modelling, appraisal, evaluation and data management, to help set the direction of policy. We are a friendly and encouraging team dedicated to professional development, equality and diversity, and offering an accommodating working environment. Many people in the team have flexible working arrangements, including part time and compressed hours

We will ensure that individuals with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodation to participate in the job application or interview process, to perform crucial job functions, and to receive other benefits and privileges of employment. Please contact us to request accommodation.
Job description
We are looking for a number of professional analysts to join the team. The roles are open to badged Government Operational Researchers, Statisticians, Economists or Social Researchers, OR those who can demonstrate the relevant knowledge and experience to meet the professional membership requirements at Grade 7 level (more details provided under “Person Specification”).

International energy trading and offshore networks

In this role, you will be responsible for building the evidence base to support policy decisions about how we trade electricity and gas with Europe. Your modelling of the energy system and appraisal of the different options for future trade will inform both our negotiations with the EU as well any legislative changes which follow. As we establish a new energy trading relationship with the EU and form new trade agreements with non-EU countries, you will lead our analysis on the role that interconnectors – the undersea cables through which we trade electricity with other countries – will play as we move towards a decarbonised and flexible power system.
Alongside this, you will be responsible for building the evidence base to inform policy decisions about the way that our offshore electricity networks are developed. This is an increasingly important area of focus as the UK aims to quadruple its offshore wind capacity over the next 10 years.

Gas decarbonisation

The way we use gas at the moment – for heating, industry and power generation – will need to change as part of meeting our decarbonisation goals. We are expecting the use of natural gas to decline as electricity takes over in some areas, whilst hydrogen and green gas will play a growing role alongside.
In this role, you will be responsible for building the evidence base to inform how we decarbonise the gas system, with a particular focus on understanding the impacts on gas networks, security of supply and market structures.
Additionally, Net Zero will require the UK’s oil and gas industry to change. An additional part of this role is to support the industry’s transition, considering the impacts on jobs, infrastructure and the changing supply and demand of fossil fuels out to 2050.
This is an emerging work area in BEIS which will add to a growing programme of work on our Net Zero gas strategy.

CfDs

Contracts for Difference (CfDs) are the Government’s flagship policy and delivery mechanism to meet our renewables ambitions and ultimately contribute to our net zero target. The contracts are determined by a series of auctions that have a number of design parameters that need to be developed through robust analysis to meet policy objectives and provide value for money.
This post is critical to successful delivery of those auctions to make sure that we get the renewable electricity generation that we need. In this role you will be responsible for leading a policy facing analyst team to develop the evidence base, input into the auction design and articulate the trade-offs of different choices.
This is a challenging role that will contribute to a high profile policy area with critical delivery milestones in the next 12 months.

Electricity systems modelling

This is a key post for BEIS, working on the department’s model of the GB power market, to ensure the delivery of robust and influential analysis. Achieving net zero by 2050 is likely to rely on electrification of a range of sectors, making analysis of the electricity market key to understanding the overall trajectory of decarbonisation.
Our main modelling tool, the Dynamic Dispatch Model, is used to project generation and investment decisions. The timescale of analysis ranges from the next few years (to inform decisions over e.g. carbon pricing or security of supply) out to strategic analysis of 2050 and beyond.

Job Description


Quality Director – are you a GCP expert who wants a Head of QA (all GxPs) – M25/M1/M11 North


This role can be based 2-3 days a week from home and in my client’s new offices on the South Cambs / Herts borders, within easy commute of Essex and East Anglia, as well as northern Home counties and North London.

About this fairly unique Quality Leadership opportunity!

I am seeking that certain special kind of Quality leader, one who thrives on bringing structure and organizational processes and thinking to new and growing smaller innovator organizations. What you will inherit will require shaping and redevelopment, where you will provide Quality counsel for GCP and Research QA, you will also manage all the GxPs (incl. PhV, GcLP, GCP, IMP, GMP), including redevelopment of the quality management system, top level policies and SOPs.

This smaller organization has a vision for their specialty medicinal area (all their NMEs are novel), and this role reports to a VP of Regulatory who will support you build your own vision and the overall quality philosophy in the organization. This VP has their own regulatory objectives to deliver on, so we really are looking for a stand-up professional, who can take the mantle and run with it.

This role is a position which will in time have a full-time team reporting into it, at first it will be semi-virtual, using a mix of contractors and freelancers but as the company grows from their mid / late phase pipeline, this role will also grow into a full QA departmental head leadership role, with eventually full-time Quality / QA Managers / Sr Specialists supporting you!

The company is using a fair number of Contract Labs and Manufacturers, as well as CROs, which will also fall under your remit of course, for Quality Oversight, so working with vendors, on technical agreements, compliance, and OOS/Investigations, or Audit findings, will also be part of this role. Additionally, you will be responsible for the European region, for any inspections preparation and hosting, regardless of which GxP it is.

I cannot think too much of what this role does not include in terms of quality assurance and quality management, so you will have to work with the leadership team to educate, escalate, and prioritize, based on your compliance expertise, and risk-based assessment, to decide where your short-term and long-term efforts will be needed.

Experience & Background

This role is applicable to Director or Associate Director levels ready to take the next step, ideally you will have good GCP and/or exp from auditing, process improvement or quality assurance management roles. Good leadership and people management skills are required.

Equally, we welcome applications from individuals who have led a quality career with a larger pharmaceutical company, and now would like something smaller, where you can have fuller oversight and ownership of all the GxPs and quality / research quality processes.

Package, Benefits & COVID

We have a digital hiring policy in place and you can be both hired and on-boarded remotely, pending the office reconvening. There is a certain amount of flexibility after Covid, in terms of working from home.

The role comes with a competitive salary (even to larger pharmaceutical companies), a decent performance bonus and a stock plan.

About the job
Summary
Do you want to be at the heart of transforming acquisition and approvals in Defence?

We need to be able to harness the potential of technology if we are to deliver battle winning capability into the hands of our Armed Forces. To do this our approach to acquisition needs to be more flexible and agile so that it can deliver at the pace we need. Improving our approach to acquisition will not only improve how effectively and efficiently we acquire equipment and support (on which we spend some £16bn a year) but will also improve how we buy other goods and services across Defence.
To deliver the changes that are needed across the Defence enterprise, the acquisition and approval transformation portfolio is driving forward three challenging programmes:

• Category management - will put in place procurement strategies for items that are purchased in multiple parts of Defence. Specialist teams will also bring improved market engagement and market direction to each category. This initiative is expected to deliver significant savings.

• Technology Exploitation - will make the changes necessary in the acquisition and approvals systems that are essential to the delivery of fast-paced, innovative technology to the front line, at a pace matching that of evolving threats, ensuring currency of technology through life.

• Culture Change - will enable the necessary shift in thinking and behaviour to make the Category Management and the Technology Exploitation programmes successful and embed a more judgement rather than process led approach, where “appropriate risk” is taken.

NHS England and NHS Improvement came together on 1 April 2019 as a new single organisation. The NHS Long Term Plan focuses on delivering integrated care to patients at the local level and we can best support the NHS to deliver this as a single integrated organisation.

At the NHS, we are reminded every day of how important life is. As a flexible working friendly organisation, we want to be sure that you can work in a way that is best for us and for our patients, and for you. Speak to us about how we might be able to accommodate a flexible working arrangement whether that’s job share, part time or another flexible pattern. In addition, although the role advertised may have an ‘home’ office base indicated, we remain committed to supporting flexibility around workplace locations. If it works for the service, we will do our best to make it work for you.

Our new operating model represents a strong shift to regional delivery supported by expert corporate teams. Local health systems are supported by our integrated regional teams who play a major leadership role in the geographies they manage.

We are jointly committed to creating and maintaining a fair and supportive working environment and culture, where contributions are fully recognised and valued by all and staff feel empowered to carry out their duties to the best of their abilities. As employers we are committed to promoting and protecting the physical and mental health and well-being of all our staff. This underpins our values as set out in the NHS Constitution, supports us to be an Employer of Choice and ultimately enables our employees to support the effective care of our patients.

The aim is to deliver high quality strategic estates advice across the NHS, facilitating STPs/ICSs to create better healthcare environments and generate cost efficiencies that will benefit clinicians, patients and the wider health economy.

This is a regional role in the Estates team. It is a challenging and diverse role working across the healthcare, social care and wider public-sector system as part of an independent strategic estates advisory function.

SELs will be partnering with senior stakeholders in STPs to support delivery of the NHS England Five Year Forward View (FYFV) by developing estates strategies and programmes which empower the transformation of care and are clearly linked to other infrastructure enablers. Critical skills in stakeholder management, thorough knowledge of the NHS, oversight of capital project delivery, commercial awareness, estates operational issues and programme management are required to be most successful.

This is a results focused role, which requires a full understanding of national health policy objectives to ensure that consequential benefits in efficiency, surplus land release, capital receipts and new housing targets are achieved.

The Estates function provides impartial advice across the wider NHS system, regardless of property ownership, advising a full range of stakeholders including Commissioners and Providers in relation to a broad range of optimisation, rationalisation, acquisition, disposal, and lease restructuring opportunities.

I am seeking that certain special kind of Quality leader, one who thrives on bringing structure and organizational processes and thinking to new and growing smaller innovator organizations. What you will inherit will require shaping and redevelopment, where you will provide Quality counsel for GCP and Research QA, you will also manage all the GxPs (incl. PhV, GcLP, GCP, IMP, GMP), including redevelopment of the quality management system, top level policies and SOPs.

This smaller organization has a vision for their speciality medicinal area (all their NMEs are novel), and this role reports to a VP of Regulatory who will support you build your own vision and the overall quality philosophy in the organization. This VP has their own regulatory objectives to deliver on, so we really are looking for a stand-up professional, who can take the mantle and run with it.

This role is a position which will in time have a full-time team reporting into it, at first it will be semi-virtual, using a mix of contractors and freelancers but as the company grows from their mid / late phase pipeline, this role will also grow into a full QA departmental head leadership role, with eventually full-time Quality / QA Managers / Sr Specialists supporting you!

The company is using a fair number of Contract Labs and Manufacturers, as well as CROs, which will also fall under your remit of course, for Quality Oversight, so working with vendors, on technical agreements, compliance, and OOS/Investigations, or Audit findings, will also be part of this role. Additionally, you will be responsible for the European region, for any inspections preparation and hosting, regardless of which GxP it is.

I cannot think too much of what this role does not include in terms of quality assurance and quality management, so you will have to work with the leadership team to educate, escalate, and prioritize, based on your compliance expertise, and risk-based assessment, to decide where your short-term and long-term efforts will be needed.

Experience & Background

It is likely you will have around 15 years’ experience in quality assurance, ideally for GCP although this could be from auditing, process improvement or quality assurance management roles, and ideally 5-8 years in a leadership role, with people management.

Equally, we welcome applications from individuals who have led a quality career with a larger pharmaceutical company, and now would like something smaller, where you can have fuller oversight and ownership of all the GxPs and quality / research quality processes.

Package, Benefits & COVID

We have a digital hiring policy in place and you can be both hired and on-boarded remotely, pending the office reconvening. There is a certain amount of flexibility after Covid, in terms of working from home. Relocations will be considered!

The role comes with a competitive Director level salary (even to larger pharmaceutical companies), a decent performance bonus and a stock plan. The company are willing to buyout a certain amount of stock and bonus from you potentially leaving your current employer, for the right person.

Are you a talented digital marketing manager who loves to explore new ways of optimising and scaling marketing channels?
Are you results-driven and motivated by your earnings, progression & the value you bring to the company?
Do you have a natural talent for marketing and understand what is needed to attract and convert new customers?
Would you love to be able to work remotely from anywhere in the world and help a team who are on a mission to make a real impact in the world?
If so, you will be very excited to learn about an opportunity to join our remote-working team at The Coaching Masters. *
What We Do *
The Coaching Masters is an online education platform that sells coaching-related information- products. Our product line includes: a membership platform, coaching certifications, NLP training, business launch programs, merchandise, global events and we are currently in the process of opening co-working spaces in south-east Asia.
Why We Do It *
We are very passionate about making a change in the world and we do that by educating people on the power of coaching and what it can do for their life as well as the lives of others. We are not just advocating for the process of coaching, but the lifestyle it can bring by being able to start your own online life-coaching business and working from anywhere in the world. We have a strong global community and have an entirely remote-working team
Where We Are Right Now *
We have built a strong community of 900 paying members, hundreds of people have taken our courses, have a team of 15, and are achieving revenues in the seven-figure mark. We’ve achieved this success in the last 18 months and has taken us a while to build the internal operations that will ensure we can scale. We now have the right team, infrastructure, marketing funnels, and scalable product-line, which means we are now looking for a talented, pro-active, Digital Marketing Manager to help scale our marketing efforts. We see paid traffic being the main focus on this role, by driving new people into our existing eco-system. There will be tweaks needed to our funnel from time to time, but as our marketing is already converting and bringing in a substantial ROI, the first area of growth will be to multiply our reach using various new traffic sources.
Our Growth-Focused Mindset *
We are very much focused on growth, so the person who is the right fit for this role will look to come into the role to transform the department. We think big, so we’d want someone to aim to double leads in the business over 3-6 months. This shouldn’t be hard based on our growth anyway, but the person for this role would be there to ensure it happens as quickly as possible. These results and growth will be compensated back in bonuses. We want to ensure you’re motivated to grow the division and are financially rewarded for doing so.
Your Experience *
The right candidate would have experience and education with online-based marketing with proven results in managing and optimising campaigns with a successful return on investment. Experience in any of the following areas is desirable, but not all of them are essential, as we are happy to either hire freelancers to maintain some channels of pay for training and courses that may allow you to acquire new skills to bring to the marketing department. However, you’d need to bring considerable experience and results to some of the following areas to be able to comfortably take control of the department and help us scale. _(Experience running paid traffic would be essential to this role.) _
Data Analysis
Influencer Marketing
Paid Traffic: Facebook, Instagram, Google, YouTube & LinkedIn
Content Marketing
Email Marketing
Affiliate Marketing
SEO
There will be a few key areas of this role:

• *Manage the existing marketing team. *Ensure they’re performing, following tasks as requested, and are giving direction to be able to grow and improve each section of the marketing department. Management duties would include the following:

o Suggest ideas weekly for growth and optimisation
o Monitor Performance for each team member & department
o Monitors KPI’s & targets of each sub-section of marketing and individual
o Escalate information about team, problems, ideas, and KPI numbers to Senior-

Management
*Carrying out Marketing Responsibilities. *Although there is a small team to support the marketing manager, including staff, directors, and freelancers, some tasks will be required to be carried out directly by the marketing manager. These tasks can be shuffled about based on results and skillset, and we also can hire new staff if it can be proven that they can generate additional income for the business. However, for now, the following tasks would be down to the Marketing Manager to carry out:
*Marketing Data & Analytics: *This will involve using software to track and analyze data to ensure targets are being met by the team, identify the key areas to increase or decrease marketing budget, as well as gathering insights into customers behavior that will allow us to improve conversions or increase leads.
*Influencer Management: *This will involve generating an influencer portfolio for promotions to promote our company webinars, or receive a gift in exchange for promotion. We will also be looking to use influencers to grow our social media following.
*Paid Traffic Management: *Running are paid ads from Facebook, YouTube, Google, LinkedIn and YouTube. Some are already set up and some will need to be started from scratch. We are currently only using half of the channels we could be using, which means the opportunity for fast growth is huge, and so is the financial bonus from increased revenue in the business too.
*Email Marketing: *Sending out daily emails to drive leads into our existing funnels and other marketing channels with the focus on converting new customers through daily valuable content and promotional offers.
Requirements *
Have at least 4 years’ experience working directly in digital marketing.
Have some form of education whether that is from university or private education.
Have previous results scaling marketing budgets with profitable ROAS.
Have a motivated & passionate outlook on digital marketing.
Have a growth mindset to learn new skills and find solutions.
Have the ability to stay motivated and work in a remote-working team with little management.
We Are Looking for A Partner Not an Employee *
The person who secures this role would need to be hard-working, and extremely fast-paced. If we have ideas, we have a work-ethic within our team that wants to see it implemented immediately. We are all about taking imperfect action and growing quickly. So, the person suited to this role would need to be self-motivated and prepared to try new things and get stuck in. To fit in with our team, you’d be focused on your results, earnings, and the impact we make in the business, rather than your basic-salary and the number of hours you put in. We are flexible with hours, but we expect the role to be embodied so it’s a part of your everyday life. If messages are being sent about in the evenings and weekends, this is not unusual – but at the same time, sitting in the spa whilst you create some new ideas, or meeting with a new influencer for cocktails in the middle of the day, is completely fine too. We see our way of working as a lifestyle, one you should enjoy, and look forward to getting started each morning!
Pro-Active Builder & Creator *
The right fit to join our team would also be okay with creating new processes and systems for themselves. We are a start-up; therefore, some systems and processes have not been set up yet, and there isn’t always guidance or support on how to do something. This role would require a willingness to research and learn new skills and show initiative on how to tackle certain objectives without always having a set list of tasks and instructions on how to complete them. We would want you to see this exciting new project for you to make your own.
Next Steps *
If you’re confident you’d be able to bring value and results to the Marketing Department and you are eager to join our team and help us push our products far and wide, throughout the world, then please send your CV and cover letter in response to the above job description outlining why you think you’d be perfect for the role. We are looking to see that someone can take the time to *read the above outline and respond accurately *to the objectives we have, showing us that you value this position and have taken the time to understand what we need from you.

Please send the CV and covering letter to the attention of the CEO, Lewis Raymond Taylor to info @ thecoachingmasters . com. Bonus points will be given for any other initiative you could offer that we allow you to stand out from other applicants. We’ll get back to you to discuss an interview if we feel you could be the right fit to join our team. We are looking to hire the right candidate immediately.

Kind Regards,

The opportunity

You’ll have the opportunity to work on business-critical engagements. In recent years we have helped investment banks to get ready for Brexit, improve their compliance with regulations such as MiFID II, EMIR, and Dodd Frank, and prepare for upcoming regulation such as FRTB and CSDR. We help organisations to prepare for market events such as the cessation of IBOR.

We also help banks to become more profitable, either by developing new revenue streams, or crucially, by reducing costs.

While we predominantly serve the UK market, our clients are global, and we collaborate extensively with our fellow capital markets teams in EMEIA, the US and APAC

We come at transformation problems in the following ways with respect to technology:
We are highly skilled at delivering and overseeing large scale technology change – from inception and requirements definition through to operational readiness. We prefer an agile methodology but are happy to work in whatever ways our clients demand.
We are increasingly bringing technology assets to clients to help accelerate transformation. Examples of these include our best-in-class MiFID II reporting analytics suite, and our end-to-end IBOR backbone. Our technology assets include proprietary EY tools as well as best-of-breed vendor tools.
We deploy team members from on-shore, near-shore and off-shore teams, and often work alongside our major alliance partners, such as Microsoft and Pega to deploy solutions. Increasingly we collaborate with FinTech firms too.
We are passionate about keeping pace with the latest emerging technology. We have recently invested in senior hires in Cloud, Digital, Intelligent Automation and AI. But we aren’t interested in technology for the sake of technology – we combine the tech mindset with EY’s deep business and regulatory knowledge in order to deploy technology intelligently to solve business problems.

Background to the Role

What is Official Development Assistance (ODA)?

ODA-funded activity focuses on outcomes that promote the long-term sustainable growth of countries on the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) list. The main ODA focus for UKRI, managed through the International Development Team, is the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) and the Newton Fund.

The Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) is a £1.5 billion fund announced by the UK Government to support cutting-edge research that addresses the challenges faced by developing countries through:

Challenge-led disciplinary and interdisciplinary research
Strengthening capacity for research and innovation within both the UK and developing countries
Providing an agile response to emergencies where there is an urgent research need.

The Newton Fund is a £735 million UK investment Fund, with partner countries providing matched resources within the Fund. The Fund was launched in 2014 and extended and expanded in 2016.

The Newton Fund aims to promote the economic development and social welfare of either the partner countries or, through working with the partner country, to address the wellbeing of communities. It will do so through strengthening partner country science and innovation capacity and unlocking further funding to support this work.

UKRI is the largest GCRF and Newton Fund Delivery Partner, but significant activity is also delivered through the Learned Societies, UK Space Agency, the British Council and the Met Office.

Business unit information

The award winning Commercial Capability Team was formed in 2014/15 to bolster departments in improving their commercial capability. A new concept for government, we have developed a suite of capability services that central government departments and wider government bodies can access. A Commercial Recruitment Hub has been created, offering a centralised recruitment service for departments to fill commercial vacancies starting from Commercial Managers progressing up to Senior Commercial Specialists. Within this hub there is a pool of centrally-employed and accredited commercial professionals that can be assigned to departments to work on commercial assignments. Once in the role, these individuals have access to training and accreditation programmes, they are assigned their own commercial career coach and benefit from a tailored talent management service. We want to be the best commercial function in the United Kingdom. Thus the Commercial Capability Program has been created to attract, retain, develop and reward these specialists, to ensure we appeal to the best in the commercial sector to come and join us. Along with providing departments with this talent pool, as a Commercial Capability Program, we also support central and wider government in commercial capability training, advice and guidance.

This role will sit within the Commercial Blueprints Team, a team critical to the success of the overall Government Commercial Function (which the Commercial Capability team sits within). It supports Commercial Directors across Whitehall to explore, test, strengthen and articulate their functional strategy and delivery plans in areas such as operational models, organisational models, functional governance and influence, stakeholder relations, systems and technology usage and so on.

The scale and complexity of this function means that we must have data at the heart our work; using insights to underpin commercial strategies, enable effective decision-making and improve the overall understanding of the function.

Working in the centre of government you will influence how the GCF uses data to create insight that improve our strategy, policy and delivery.

Current working from home arrangement apply. Post Covid-19, the role will be based in London (10 South Colonnade, Canary Wharf) or Manchester (Trinity Bridge House, 2 Dearmans Pl, Salford, M3 5BN). If based in Manchester, travel to London may be required on occasion to attend team meetings etc.

About the job
Summary
Do you want to help the UK reach its climate change goals? Do you have a passion for using evidence to underpin policy making? We want enthusiastic professional analysts to join our Energy and Security Analysis team, working on issues that have a real impact on everyone’s everyday lives.

In 2019, the Government set an ambitious target for the UK to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. To help us reach that target we need to make decisions now about the way we generate and use energy in the future, as well as ensuring that our energy system is both affordable and secure. Those decisions need to be underpinned and informed by high quality analysis. In the Energy Security and Analysis team, we play a fundamental role throughout the policy cycle, from development through to implementation and evaluation. The team of around 50 multidisciplinary analysts work together using a range of techniques including modelling, appraisal, evaluation and data management, to help set the direction of policy. We are a friendly and encouraging team dedicated to professional development, equality and diversity, and offering an accommodating working environment. Many people in the team have flexible working arrangements, including part time and compressed hours

We will ensure that individuals with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodation to participate in the job application or interview process, to perform crucial job functions, and to receive other benefits and privileges of employment. Please contact us to request accommodation.
Job description
We are looking for a number of professional analysts to join the team. The roles are open to badged Government Operational Researchers, Statisticians, Economists or Social Researchers, OR those who can demonstrate the relevant knowledge and experience to meet the professional membership requirements at Grade 7 level (more details provided under “Person Specification”).

International energy trading and offshore networks

In this role, you will be responsible for building the evidence base to support policy decisions about how we trade electricity and gas with Europe. Your modelling of the energy system and appraisal of the different options for future trade will inform both our negotiations with the EU as well any legislative changes which follow. As we establish a new energy trading relationship with the EU and form new trade agreements with non-EU countries, you will lead our analysis on the role that interconnectors – the undersea cables through which we trade electricity with other countries – will play as we move towards a decarbonised and flexible power system.
Alongside this, you will be responsible for building the evidence base to inform policy decisions about the way that our offshore electricity networks are developed. This is an increasingly important area of focus as the UK aims to quadruple its offshore wind capacity over the next 10 years.

Gas decarbonisation

The way we use gas at the moment – for heating, industry and power generation – will need to change as part of meeting our decarbonisation goals. We are expecting the use of natural gas to decline as electricity takes over in some areas, whilst hydrogen and green gas will play a growing role alongside.
In this role, you will be responsible for building the evidence base to inform how we decarbonise the gas system, with a particular focus on understanding the impacts on gas networks, security of supply and market structures.
Additionally, Net Zero will require the UK’s oil and gas industry to change. An additional part of this role is to support the industry’s transition, considering the impacts on jobs, infrastructure and the changing supply and demand of fossil fuels out to 2050.
This is an emerging work area in BEIS which will add to a growing programme of work on our Net Zero gas strategy.

CfDs

Contracts for Difference (CfDs) are the Government’s flagship policy and delivery mechanism to meet our renewables ambitions and ultimately contribute to our net zero target. The contracts are determined by a series of auctions that have a number of design parameters that need to be developed through robust analysis to meet policy objectives and provide value for money.
This post is critical to successful delivery of those auctions to make sure that we get the renewable electricity generation that we need. In this role you will be responsible for leading a policy facing analyst team to develop the evidence base, input into the auction design and articulate the trade-offs of different choices.
This is a challenging role that will contribute to a high profile policy area with critical delivery milestones in the next 12 months.

Electricity systems modelling

This is a key post for BEIS, working on the department’s model of the GB power market, to ensure the delivery of robust and influential analysis. Achieving net zero by 2050 is likely to rely on electrification of a range of sectors, making analysis of the electricity market key to understanding the overall trajectory of decarbonisation.
Our main modelling tool, the Dynamic Dispatch Model, is used to project generation and investment decisions. The timescale of analysis ranges from the next few years (to inform decisions over e.g. carbon pricing or security of supply) out to strategic analysis of 2050 and beyond. The model underpins all major electricity policy decisions, and its importance is recognised by senior colleagues, ministers, other government departments and industry.
You will be working as part of a multi-disciplinary team, taking responsibility for updating and developing parts of the model, and delivering analysis on a range of different policy areas.

Nuclear policy analyst

The UK’s current nuclear fleet forms an essential part of a diverse energy mix, providing reliable and carbon-free electricity generation. Nuclear policy areas range from new nuclear builds, disposal of nuclear waste, decommissioning of plants at the end of their life, protecting the UK’s civil nuclear infrastructure, exploring the potential of new nuclear technologies and more!
This role sits within the analytical team supporting the two nuclear directorates within BEIS and provides an excellent opportunity to be involved in the delivery of legislation over a range of areas.
You will work as part of a multi-disciplinary team and be involved with longer-term projects, as well as quick turnaround ad hoc requests for data and analysis, in a role that will involve working with senior policy officials and analysts within BEIS as well as other public bodies and Government Departments.

Responsibilities
In all cases, the roles will provide opportunities to:
• use existing models and analytical tools to build the evidence base and inform thinking in relation to the UK energy system;
• lead analytical work programmes, including developing new analysis and tools – e.g. through developing novel methods or procuring external research and consultancy;
• work with a range of partners, such as legal, commercial and technical specialists from within the Department, across other Government departments as well as external organisations such as Ofgem and National Grid; and
• oversee and develop junior analysts.

Person specification:

We are seeking someone with an enthusiasm for developing and using analysis to help influence policy decisions.

Essential criteria:

• A proven track-record of developing and overseeing high-quality and influential analysis, such as data analysis, modelling, cost-benefit analysis, option appraisals, quantitative research or evaluation.
• Strong communication skills, in particular, around ensuring analysis is accessible to decision-makers and the public.
• Proven leadership and organisational skills to manage analytical workstreams and ensure delivery of both fast-paced work and longer-term projects.
• Strong collaborations skills to work with policy teams and external partners.
