Grabango is the leading provider of checkout-free shopper technology for existing stores. Founded by Will Glaser (co-founder/former CTO of Pandora Media), the Grabango team has developed the only enterprise class solution for large store chains in the market today. Grabango's system accommodates thousands of store locations, hundreds of thousands of SKUs and millions of square feet across a given retail enterprise.

We're a growing group of kind, curious, self-directed people working towards a common goal. We delight in taking risks and testing hypotheses in a collaborative and supportive environment. Our ability to celebrate both our successes and failures as milestones of growth opens the door to tremendous breakthroughs.

Computer vision and machine learning are at the core of our patent pending technology. Our accomplished team is a potent combination of technology and commerce professionals that are looking to ""Eliminate lines and save people time!""

Role Overview:

Grabango seeks an experienced backend software engineer to help design and build its distributed systems, ML/CV, and data pipelining infrastructures. In order to generate a receipt based on computer vision only, we need to have tools to process massive amounts of video and other downstream data, making decisions about real-world events at every layer of our infrastructure simultaneously. Additionally, the system doing this work needs to be able to scale horizontally, and be fault tolerant at every layer.

We are looking for a flexible, curious engineer with deep experience of high-throughput distributed systems using modern tooling and languages. Though we use many tools, depth of experience with Python and its use with distributed and real-time systems (Celery + Redis / RabbitMQ, Kafka + Faust, etc) will be central to this role. Deep working experience with the placement of different kinds of data in microservice architectures will be a critical element of this role as we work towards the infinitely scalable future. Shared tools such as Kubernetes, Docker and Git should be second-nature.

As a deeply technical lead, the ideal candidate will prefer spending about 50% of their time actually writing code, splitting the rest between planning and mentorship and code review. We are looking for an engineer who has already seen success in growing their team around them, as well as engineering highly available high-throughput distributed systems.

Collaborating on system design to optimize petabyte-scale data set management
Supporting frontend developers in expanding our labeling and management system
Within the first 6 months
Designing distributed computing infrastructure for real time data processing
Scaling computer vision algorithms to run massively parallel in production
Determining technical roadmap based on current tech maturity and business objectives

What you should have:


5+ years Python experience with mastery of modern language features and libraries
Depth of experience with large scale distributed and real-time systems, microservices, infrastructure, frameworks, and datastores
Second-nature familiarity with shared tools: Kubernetes, Docker, Git, Kafka, Redis
You recognize the need to balance pragmatism and creativity
You have made mistakes, learned from them and avoided making them again.
You are able to use your knowledge and experience to help solve problems that may not be in your field of expertise
You work well with a diverse team of high-quality people focused on customer delight.
You can rapidly become familiar with and apply new tools and technologies

Educations & Certifications:


BS or equivalent experience in Computer Science or Computer Engineering

Grabango Values:
Integrity: Do the right thing, particularly when you don't have to.

Bold Innovation: Think recklessly, but temper your actions with pragmatism.

People Matter: Hire the best, and treasure them.

Don't Live with Broken: Have the courage to admit mistakes, and the urgency to correct them.

Customer Focus: Deliver beyond expectations, both internally and externally.

Inclusion: Foster an environment that welcomes all.

Simplify: Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.

Grabango is proud to be an equal opportunity employer and is committed to developing a workplace where diversity and inclusion are an essential part of who we are. We strive to hire and support a workforce as diverse as our shopper base, so we can develop products and services that best suit our customers.

We Are Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.",4.2,"Cisco Systems

Qualia engineers learn this framework, and design patterns more generally, directly from the creator of the framework our front end is built on! Very few companies can say that.
As part of our focus on continual learning and development, a Qualia team member gives an educational talk on something they're interested in every Thursday to the entire engineering and product team.

107,Web developer,San Francisco,Software Engineer,-1,"Over the coming years, biotech will fundamentally rewrite the way we live. Gene editing and cell therapy are dramatically changing how we treat cancer and other major illnesses. Biofuels and biomaterials are transforming the cars we drive, the clothes we wear, and the makeup of everyday objects. Crop science and synthetic biology are producing sustainable and ethical food. Benchling's mission is to accelerate the research that propels us towards this reality, and magnify its impact, through modern software.

Every day, hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world use Benchling in their efforts to solve humanity's most pressing problems. For these scientists, Benchling is the central technology they use to conduct their research.


Benchling was founded by a team of MIT graduates and has raised funding from Benchmark, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, and Y Combinator. Our customers include pharmaceutical giants, leading biotechs, and the world's most renowned research institutes.

WHAT YOU WILL DO
Own projects end-to-end, from initial design, to prototype, to large-scale rollout.
Design and implement backend models and API endpoints for complex scientific workflows.
Design and implement rich frontend components and architecture. We build and operate one of the largest, richest React applications out there and power complex scientific analyses.
Work closely with product managers, designers, marketing, and sales to ensure the right context is being shared.
Help rapidly scale our product and team. As a member of the engineering team, you'll be an integral part of how we mature our tooling, best practices, engineering processes, and hiring.
ABOUT YOU
Have 3+ years of experience in software engineering.
Build software with a product-first approach. You ship code quickly and care about the real world impact of your code.
Have strong abilities in problem solving and iterating on feedback.
Enjoy ownership and building key pieces of product.
Are interested in learning more about life science (prior knowledge is not required; desire to learn is a must).
YOU MIGHT WORK ON

Check out our engineering blog for some examples of past work. Here are some other examples of recent and future projects:
Tools to simulate DNA assembly - computers can assist scientists by informing scientific decisions with complex calculations. Our bulk assembly tool allows scientists to simulate constructing hundreds of DNA constructs in parallel, visualizing the end result and highlighting potential issues.
Complex querying and visualization tools - The big advantage of keeping all your data stored in one system is that you can query that data all at once, without digging up multiple sources. This works best when you can query Benchling the same way you can query a database: by choosing from a large number of possible filters on any related objects, joining together various sources, and performing aggregations. We want to enable this in a user-friendly experience, without leaving your browser.
A customizable computation platform - Biologics are typically large protein complexes composed of a number of shared parts. We want to let scientists specify computations that can aggregate data across all of these related entities to surface derived values, which can be used in everything from data analysis to naming schemes. Scientists may develop custom protein analysis algorithms or proprietary validation logic - they'll be able to hook in custom code and push that computation to Benchling.
Data warehouse as a product - customers can click a button and spin up a fully-managed, query-able warehouse with all their Benchling data in one place. Customers get the full power of Redshift/Postgres without having to manage ETL pipelines or tune Postgres configuration values.
A new permissions system - Our existing permission system relies on Read/Write/Admin access that can only be applied at the top level of the file hierarchy. To roll out to enterprises with 500+ users, we need to offer them fine-grained control around exactly what actions a user can take and let them manage these in a hierarchical fashion.
OUR VALUES
Empower through information. We explain the ""why"" behind every decision, unless there are highly sensitive circumstances. We're honest about how we're doing, especially in difficult times. We believe that sharing information builds trust and enables better decision-making.
Rely on tenacity. Hard work is one of the greatest factors to determine success and is fully under our control. We must make the most of every day by bringing the highest level of determination. Dreaming big is not enough.
Raise the bar. Pushing ourselves and others to improve will be uncomfortable and at times result in failure. However, it's critical to our success. We're dedicated to creating a place where everyone feels challenged to improve.
Build a lever. We choose to build tools and infrastructure that will help others make world-changing innovations. There's less glory in it, but in the words of Archimedes, ""Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.""

132,Web developer,San Francisco,"Software Engineer, Front End",-1,"At Nuna, our mission is to make high-quality healthcare affordable for everyone. We are dedicated to tackling one of our nation's biggest problems with ingenuity, creativity, and a keen moral compass.

Nuna is committed to simple principles: a rigorous understanding of data, modern technology, and most importantly, compassion and care for our fellow human. We want to know what really works, what doesn't—and why.

Nuna partners with healthcare payers, including government agencies and health plans, to turn data into learnings and information into meaning.

Your team


In Nuna Engineering, we build technology to enable users (from data scientists to analysts to policy-makers) to understand healthcare data while ensuring its integrity, security and privacy. Our work runs the gamut from joining streams of messy real-world data to building queryable data warehouses to constructing visualizations and dashboards that provide actionable insight. We build systems that are auditable, as automated as possible, an accurate representation of the underlying data, and, most importantly, responsive to our end users' needs. We strive for a creative, collaborative engineering environment that implements best practices of peer review, readability, maintainability, and security of the code base and infrastructure.

The Nuna Web Engineering team is Nuna's full stack application & frontend engineering team. We build Nuna's user-facing web apps & APIs from the databases to the UIs. We work with the output of Nuna's Data Platform, turning large datasets into innovative data visualizations, easy-to-understand dashboards, and highly reliable APIs. We are building for the long term with a focus on increasing engineer velocity across Nuna by maintaining a UI components library, an API-in-a-box kit, and standardized development and deployment infrastructure tooling for all of Nuna's application development. We ensure enterprise-grade stability and startup-grade velocity by maintaining a well-tested code base and infrastructure that is secure-by-default.

Your impact


Web Engineering builds every product our users interact with. We measure our products' success by how much they improve care and lower costs. As an engineering-led culture, you will be at the vanguard of making healthcare work for all Americans. Today, you'll be helping hospitals improve quality of care, enabling health plans to pay for quality-of-care not quantity-of-care, and matching patients to optimal doctors. Tomorrow, you'll be creating even bigger and better products to shape this industry.

Your opportunities
You'll build products that change the dynamics and incentives of the healthcare industry, changing a zero-sum game of competition between payers and providers into patient-centered collaboration.
You'll put data science magic (like predictive analytics and dynamic modeling) into our users' hands through interactive features in collaboration with the Data Engineering & Data Science teams.
You'll design APIs and service architectures that multiply the effectiveness of internal and external developers serving millions of patients.
You'll build innovative and beautiful data visualizations that illuminate the path towards higher quality care at lower cost.
You'll manage our high stakes production environment, ensuring high availability/low latency and protecting our sensitive data with rigorous security.
You'll identify big opportunities to improve our technology and our products, blazing trails through ambiguity.
You'll mentor more junior engineers and, in turn, learn from more senior engineers, because we are learners, not knowers, and growing Nuna's people is the most reliable way to scale our impact.
You'll work as part of a team, not in a silo. At Nuna we rise by lifting others
You bring


As a full-stack application engineering team, we need a wide array of skills as a whole. We want UX engineers, backend engineers, full stack engineers, and everything in between. No single engineer needs to cover every single dimension, so don't take this as a literal requirements checklist. We're excited to talk with you if you bring some or all of the following:
Experience building production-hardened web services, with consideration for security, performance, scalability, reliability, and repeatability. Familiarity with application server frameworks like Django.
