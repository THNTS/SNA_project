Planet efficiently and safely operates several medium and high resolution spacecraft constellations. Managing these valuable assets is a highly technical feat and the teams that do so consist of skilled engineers from a variety of backgrounds, having collectively worked on more than 30 space missions. Together, these teams support spacecraft commissioning and anomaly resolution, maintaining uptime and fleet performance, lead and execute on-orbit experiments and special activities, analyze spacecraft data, and develop tools and processes to support efficient multi-mission operations.

Our goal is to minimize manual operator oversight, so a large part of this role will be automating ongoing mission operations and optimizing workflows. You can anticipate working in a close collaborative environment, frequently communicating with hardware and software experts to understand anomalies, develop procedures and shape the way we do operations. Our team is the first to detect and triage anomalous behavior, therefore an understanding of how each spacecraft subsystem relates to one another is important. Expect to be in the middle of it all, as the work of the Mission Ops team is essential to Planet's success.

The Responsibilities:
Develop a thorough understanding of a spacecraft bus, and how it is operated
Develop automated responses and processes for any manual operations
Build and edit python scripts to carry out activities on a spacecraft
Monitor all spacecraft for proper operation, responding to all off-nominal contingencies (telemetry limit violations, configuration and status changes, subsystem and operational anomalies, etc)
Participate in on-call rotation in support of spacecraft uptime
What You Bring:
Bachelor's Degree in an Engineering, Software, or Science related field from an accredited college or technical school
Fundamental understanding of aerospace, automotive, device or other fleet / distributed systems
Experience with Python scripting, PSQL (or SQL equivalent), command line interface, and Git version control
Demonstrable experience in exploratory data analysis and visualization
Strong troubleshooting, analytical skills and the enthusiasm to dig down rabbit holes to debug issues
Strong communication and organizational skills
Ability to triage, prioritize, and execute several independent tasks in an operational environment
Problem solving oriented and self starter attitude
What Makes You Stand Out:
Previous satellite operations, space mission experience or space systems integration & test experience
Experience in process automation or workflow management (design, software development, or business related)
Experience in risk assessment/management, failure investigation and root cause methodologies
Experience using project management tools and issue trackers

You have the skills to debug both systems and software to assess whether a bug is critical or annoying. You have years of industry experience in setting top development environments, building internal web-apps and tools, and living in the cloud. Ideally, you have walked the tech start-top road before.
